      flip flops are configured such that they both start at 0 when an AS cycle starts.  After 2 CLK_16M cycles the 
      DELAY2 signal is set to 1, which directly unasserts the IDE /WR pin.  The allows the /WR pin to have an active rising
      edge BEFORE the end of the CPU cpu cycle.  This is critical to allow the IDE interface to latch data, since at the end
      of the cycle the output buffers to the IDE inteface are turned off.  This was a fix from the original design which 
      assumed the rising edge of the write signal would be sufficienctly ahead of the buffers getting turned off.
