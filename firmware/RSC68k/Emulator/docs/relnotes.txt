Build 995
---------
* Release that includes patient drop-down list/treatment

* Start of MagStim support

Beta 9
------
* Completely revamped window/widget APIs and operation to be mouse centric
rather than touch screen centric

* Eliminated unused sg_bTouchScreenOverride functionality and sg_bPointerValid
and all underlying code that went with it. No longer needed.

* Added support API for keyboard input routine(s) with WidgetKeyHit() API

* Removed bOffWidgetTracking from widget.h/SWidget structure. Not used any longer.

* Added vpUserData and pCallbackDestroy function pointers/data for user defined
data associated with a widget (and a callback when the widget is destroyed)

Beta 8
------
* Completely rewrote message layering. Now it's all based off of callbacks and
no messages are lost

* Added display of MagPro intensity setting in MRTClient

* Massively extended MagPro simulator code to allow for manual disable/enable
from the virtual MagPro side and adjustability of the intensity. Also acts like
a real MagPro, in that it disables itself after 5 minutes

* MRTClient can survive having a USB cable being removed as long as it's not
within a training cycle

* Vastly improved startup/shutdown time

* MRTClient pauses now when the MagPro is disabled from its front panel

* Added several MagPro helper functions to keep MagPro command handling out
of the MRT mainline code (MagProSetEnable() and MagProSendIntensity())

* Bug fix to training-side display code (wasn't using red numbering when in
a train period). Also fixed an off-by-one problem with it.

* Split up MagPro init to an init/preinit so semaphores, etc.. could be
initialized before any MagPro activity was ready (needed for session init)

* Modified TreatmentTerminate() so it could selectively enable or disable the
UI's buttons

* Code now sends enable commands at the beginning of a start of a session and
if a session is resumed (prevents the MagPro from getting disabled)

* Fixed "off by 1" bug in "periods complete" display (was displaying one too 
few)

* Added GCSerialIsOpen() API to see if a serial port has disappeared or not
without having to rely on side effects of its operation

Beta 7 
------
* Modified release code so it uses Windows' heap management instead of the
debug heap manager (reduces overall memory utilization)

* Moved log information into a Logs folder

* Added unicode support

* Modified script parsing code so it can accepts // style comments and blank
lines

* Fixed nonresponsive UI problem (queue code rewritten)

* Updated dial position to correspond with new graphics

* Bug fix to keep code from seg faulting at end of treatment

* Fix to countdown dial so it displays the remaining time properly

* Added coil position display

* Added total periods/periods remaining display

* Many internal changes and updates/upgrades

Beta 5
------
* Fixed textual overdraw/turds problem. This had to do with the advance of
a font character not being as large as the X size of the pixels for the
character

* Fixed bug where clicking +1 Period during a paused MRT state causes the
train/intertrain timer to disappear

* Removed setting of MagPro settings upon startup. This is a request from
Alex.

* Turned raw data dumping to the log file back on again. This is only for
this release to figure out where bytes are being dropped/missed via the
MagPro, but will likely screw up the pulse timing.

Beta 4
------
* +1 Period counter display now stays and doesn't disappear when additional
periods are executed

* Fixed inability to shut down when "Searching" for the MagPro

* Reordered subsystem shutdown components to prevent intermittent seg faults
during shutdown

* Fixed UI so all MRT buttons are disabled on start (so they don't glitch on
startup)

* Moved logging to its own thread. This eliminates the possibility of the
logging process from holding up the main code.

* Modified the treatment thread so it would continue to run to the end of its
train period even if the application has crashed elsewhere. This ensures the
patient doesn't get treatment interrupted in the case of an app crash.

* Modified message receive thread to reset the receive character state machine
when it times out. This may help alleviate/fix startup/shutdown reconnection
issues with the MagPro.

* Added thread names so it's easier to debug under MSVC 2005

* Added text in "About" so we can tell what version we're dealing with

Beta 3
------
* Added full screen setting for release mode (no longer windowed), but still
windowed for debug mode

* Added ability to shut down the app with the in-app "X". Synchronized all
threads so they cleanly shut down.

* Fixed +1 period. It was adding the intertrain period twice instead of the
train + intertrain time

* Limited total additional periods to 10. +1 Period button gets disabled when
it reaches 10.

* Fixed treatment pause time so the train phase would continue to pulse when
it was resumed. The treatment timer was looking at linear time instead of
cumulative time.

* Changed +1 Period display to display the number of periods added and doesn't
count down as it did before

* Drastically improved the flickering issue with the period timer

* When a session is paused during the training cycle and resumed, it will not
issue train pulses for the remainder of the training cycle

* Modified code to use reminder_background.png for the demo

Beta 2
------
* Added sound engine and train warning sound

* Added pause/resume button changing based upon state of the treatment

* Added volume control and train warning sound slider support

* Fixed pausing so it wouldn't continue to run the 1SEC timer (internal 
only, not visible to the user)

* Collapsed "was button hit" code into a single routine which radically 
simplified the code

Beta 1
------
* First functional release
