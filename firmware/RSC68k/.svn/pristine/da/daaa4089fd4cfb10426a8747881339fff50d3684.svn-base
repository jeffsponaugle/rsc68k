<P>
The <CODE>make</CODE> utility automatically determines which pieces of a large
program need to be recompiled, and issues commands to recompile them.
This manual describes GNU <CODE>make</CODE>, which was implemented by Richard
Stallman and Roland McGrath.  Development since Version 3.76 has been
handled by Paul D. Smith.

</P>
<P>
GNU <CODE>make</CODE> conforms to section 6.2 of <CITE>IEEE Standard
1003.2-1992</CITE> (POSIX.2).
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>

</P>
<P>
Our examples show C programs, since they are most common, but you can use
<CODE>make</CODE> with any programming language whose compiler can be run with a
shell command.  Indeed, <CODE>make</CODE> is not limited to programs.  You can
use it to describe any task where some files must be updated automatically
from others whenever the others change.

</P>

<P>
To prepare to use <CODE>make</CODE>, you must write a file called
the <STRONG>makefile</STRONG> that describes the relationships among files
in your program and provides commands for updating each file.
In a program, typically, the executable file is updated from object
files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.
</P>
<P>
Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files,
this simple shell command:

</P>

<PRE>
make
</PRE>

<P>
suffices to perform all necessary recompilations.  The <CODE>make</CODE> program
uses the makefile data base and the last-modification times of the files to
decide which of the files need to be updated.  For each of those files, it
issues the commands recorded in the data base.

</P>
<P>
You can provide command line arguments to <CODE>make</CODE> to control which
files should be recompiled, or how.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC85">How to Run <CODE>make</CODE></A>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="make.html#TOC2">How to Read This Manual</A></H2>

<P>
If you are new to <CODE>make</CODE>, or are looking for a general
introduction, read the first few sections of each chapter, skipping the
later sections.  In each chapter, the first few sections contain
introductory or general information and the later sections contain
specialized or technical information.
The exception is section <A HREF="make.html#SEC4">An Introduction to Makefiles</A>,
all of which is introductory.

</P>
<P>
If you are familiar with other <CODE>make</CODE> programs, see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC114">Features of GNU <CODE>make</CODE></A>, which lists the enhancements GNU
<CODE>make</CODE> has, and section <A HREF="make.html#SEC115">Incompatibilities and Missing Features</A>, which explains the few things GNU <CODE>make</CODE> lacks that
others have.

<P>
If you have problems with GNU <CODE>make</CODE> or think you've found a bug,
please report it to the developers; we cannot promise to do anything but
we might well want to fix it.

</P>
<P>
Before reporting a bug, make sure you've actually found a real bug.
Carefully reread the documentation and see if it really says you can do
what you're trying to do.  If it's not clear whether you should be able
to do something or not, report that too; it's a bug in the
documentation!

</P>
<P>
Before reporting a bug or trying to fix it yourself, try to isolate it
to the smallest possible makefile that reproduces the problem.  Then
send us the makefile and the exact results <CODE>make</CODE> gave you.  Also
say what you expected to occur; this will help us decide whether the
problem was really in the documentation.

</P>
<P>
Once you've got a precise problem, please send electronic mail to:

</P>

<PRE>
    bug-make@gnu.org
</PRE>

<P>
Please include the version number of <CODE>make</CODE> you are using.  You can
get this information with the command <SAMP>`make --version'</SAMP>.
Be sure also to include the type of machine and operating system you are
using.  If possible, include the contents of the file <TT>`config.h'</TT>
that is generated by the configuration process.

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="make.html#TOC4">An Introduction to Makefiles</A></H1>

<P>
You need a file called a <STRONG>makefile</STRONG> to tell <CODE>make</CODE> what to do.
Most often, the makefile tells <CODE>make</CODE> how to compile and link a
program.
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>

</P>
<P>
In this chapter, we will discuss a simple makefile that describes how to
compile and link a text editor which consists of eight C source files
and three header files.  The makefile can also tell <CODE>make</CODE> how to
run miscellaneous commands when explicitly asked (for example, to remove
certain files as a clean-up operation).  To see a more complex example
of a makefile, see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC125">Complex Makefile Example</A>.

</P>
<P>
When <CODE>make</CODE> recompiles the editor, each changed C source file
must be recompiled.  If a header file has changed, each C source file
that includes the header file must be recompiled to be safe.  Each
compilation produces an object file corresponding to the source file.
Finally, if any source file has been recompiled, all the object files,
whether newly made or saved from previous compilations, must be linked
together to produce the new executable editor.
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>

<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="make.html#TOC5">What a Rule Looks Like</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>

</P>
<P>
A simple makefile consists of "rules" with the following shape:

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>

<PRE>
<VAR>target</VAR> ... : <VAR>prerequisites</VAR> ...
        <VAR>command</VAR>
        ...
        ...
</PRE>

<P>
A <STRONG>target</STRONG> is usually the name of a file that is generated by a
program; examples of targets are executable or object files.  A target
can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as <SAMP>`clean'</SAMP>
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC33">Phony Targets</A>).

</P>
<P>
A <STRONG>prerequisite</STRONG> is a file that is used as input to create the
target.  A target often depends on several files.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
A <STRONG>command</STRONG> is an action that <CODE>make</CODE> carries out.
A rule may have more than one command, each on its own line.
<STRONG>Please note:</STRONG> you need to put a tab character at the beginning of
every command line!  This is an obscurity that catches the unwary.

</P>
<P>
Usually a command is in a rule with prerequisites and serves to create a
target file if any of the prerequisites change.  However, the rule that
specifies commands for the target need not have prerequisites.  For
example, the rule containing the delete command associated with the
target <SAMP>`clean'</SAMP> does not have prerequisites.

</P>
<P>
A <STRONG>rule</STRONG>, then, explains how and when to remake certain files
which are the targets of the particular rule.  <CODE>make</CODE> carries out
the commands on the prerequisites to create or update the target.  A
rule can also explain how and when to carry out an action.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC20">Writing Rules</A>.

</P>
<P>
A makefile may contain other text besides rules, but a simple makefile
need only contain rules.  Rules may look somewhat more complicated
than shown in this template, but all fit the pattern more or less.

</P>

</P>
<P>
Here is a straightforward makefile that describes the way an
executable file called <CODE>edit</CODE> depends on eight object files
which, in turn, depend on eight C source and three header files.

</P>
<P>
In this example, all the C files include <TT>`defs.h'</TT>, but only those
defining editing commands include <TT>`command.h'</TT>, and only low
level files that change the editor buffer include <TT>`buffer.h'</TT>.

</P>

<PRE>
edit : main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
       insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
        cc -o edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
                   insert.o search.o files.o utils.o

main.o : main.c defs.h
        cc -c main.c
kbd.o : kbd.c defs.h command.h
        cc -c kbd.c
command.o : command.c defs.h command.h
        cc -c command.c

        cc -c files.c

        cc -c utils.c

<P>
We split each long line into two lines using backslash-newline; this is
like using one long line, but is easier to read.
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>

</P>
<P>
To use this makefile to create the executable file called <TT>`edit'</TT>,
type:

</P>

<PRE>
make
</PRE>

<P>
To use this makefile to delete the executable file and all the object
files from the directory, type:

</P>

<PRE>
make clean
</PRE>

<P>
In the example makefile, the targets include the executable file
<SAMP>`edit'</SAMP>, and the object files <SAMP>`main.o'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`kbd.o'</SAMP>.  The
prerequisites are files such as <SAMP>`main.c'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`defs.h'</SAMP>.
In fact, each <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> file is both a target and a prerequisite.
Commands include <SAMP>`cc -c main.c'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`cc -c kbd.c'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
When a target is a file, it needs to be recompiled or relinked if any
of its prerequisites change.  In addition, any prerequisites that are
themselves automatically generated should be updated first.  In this
example, <TT>`edit'</TT> depends on each of the eight object files; the
object file <TT>`main.o'</TT> depends on the source file <TT>`main.c'</TT> and
on the header file <TT>`defs.h'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
A shell command follows each line that contains a target and
prerequisites.  These shell commands say how to update the target file.
A tab character must come at the beginning of every command line to
distinguish commands lines from other lines in the makefile.  (Bear in
mind that <CODE>make</CODE> does not know anything about how the commands
work.  It is up to you to supply commands that will update the target
file properly.  All <CODE>make</CODE> does is execute the commands in the rule
you have specified when the target file needs to be updated.)
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>

</P>
<P>
The target <SAMP>`clean'</SAMP> is not a file, but merely the name of an
action.  Since you
normally
do not want to carry out the actions in this rule, <SAMP>`clean'</SAMP> is not a prerequisite of any other rule.
Consequently, <CODE>make</CODE> never does anything with it unless you tell
it specifically.  Note that this rule not only is not a prerequisite, it
also does not have any prerequisites, so the only purpose of the rule
is to run the specified commands.  Targets that do not refer to files
but are just actions are called <STRONG>phony targets</STRONG>.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC33">Phony Targets</A>, for information about this kind of target.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC48">Errors in Commands</A>, to see how to cause <CODE>make</CODE> to ignore errors
from <CODE>rm</CODE> or any other command.

<A NAME="IDX27"></A>

<P>
By default, <CODE>make</CODE> starts with the first target (not targets whose
names start with <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>).  This is called the <STRONG>default goal</STRONG>.
(<STRONG>Goals</STRONG> are the targets that <CODE>make</CODE> strives ultimately to
update.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC87">Arguments to Specify the Goals</A>.)
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>

</P>
<P>
In the simple example of the previous section, the default goal is to
update the executable program <TT>`edit'</TT>; therefore, we put that rule
first.

</P>
<P>
Thus, when you give the command:

</P>

<PRE>
make
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>make</CODE> reads the makefile in the current directory and begins by
processing the first rule.  In the example, this rule is for relinking
<TT>`edit'</TT>; but before <CODE>make</CODE> can fully process this rule, it
must process the rules for the files that <TT>`edit'</TT> depends on,
which in this case are the object files.  Each of these files is
processed according to its own rule.  These rules say to update each
<SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> file by compiling its source file.  The recompilation must
be done if the source file, or any of the header files named as
prerequisites, is more recent than the object file, or if the object
file does not exist.

</P>
<P>
The other rules are processed because their targets appear as
prerequisites of the goal.  If some other rule is not depended on by the
goal (or anything it depends on, etc.), that rule is not processed,
unless you tell <CODE>make</CODE> to do so (with a command such as
<CODE>make clean</CODE>).

</P>
<P>
Before recompiling an object file, <CODE>make</CODE> considers updating its
prerequisites, the source file and header files.  This makefile does not
specify anything to be done for them--the <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`.h'</SAMP> files
are not the targets of any rules--so <CODE>make</CODE> does nothing for these
files.  But <CODE>make</CODE> would update automatically generated C programs,
such as those made by Bison or Yacc, by their own rules at this time.

</P>
<P>
After recompiling whichever object files need it, <CODE>make</CODE> decides
whether to relink <TT>`edit'</TT>.  This must be done if the file
<TT>`edit'</TT> does not exist, or if any of the object files are newer than
it.  If an object file was just recompiled, it is now newer than
<TT>`edit'</TT>, so <TT>`edit'</TT> is relinked.
<A NAME="IDX32"></A>

</P>
<P>
Thus, if we change the file <TT>`insert.c'</TT> and run <CODE>make</CODE>,
<CODE>make</CODE> will compile that file to update <TT>`insert.o'</TT>, and then
link <TT>`edit'</TT>.  If we change the file <TT>`command.h'</TT> and run
<CODE>make</CODE>, <CODE>make</CODE> will recompile the object files <TT>`kbd.o'</TT>,
<TT>`command.o'</TT> and <TT>`files.o'</TT> and then link the file <TT>`edit'</TT>.

In our example, we had to list all the object files twice in the rule for

<A NAME="IDX35"></A>
Such duplication is error-prone; if a new object file is added to the
system, we might add it to one list and forget the other.  We can eliminate
the risk and simplify the makefile by using a variable.  <STRONG>Variables</STRONG>
allow a text string to be defined once and substituted in multiple places
later (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC57">How to Use Variables</A>).

It is standard practice for every makefile to have a variable named
<CODE>objects</CODE>, <CODE>OBJECTS</CODE>, <CODE>objs</CODE>, <CODE>OBJS</CODE>, <CODE>obj</CODE>,
or <CODE>OBJ</CODE> which is a list of all object file names.  We would
define such a variable <CODE>objects</CODE> with a line like this in the
makefile:
</P>

<PRE>
objects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
          insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
</PRE>

<P>
Then, each place we want to put a list of the object file names, we can
substitute the variable's value by writing <SAMP>`$(objects)'</SAMP>
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC57">How to Use Variables</A>).

</P>
<P>
Here is how the complete simple makefile looks when you use a variable
for the object files:

<P>
It is not necessary to spell out the commands for compiling the individual
C source files, because <CODE>make</CODE> can figure them out: it has an
<STRONG>implicit rule</STRONG> for updating a <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> file from a correspondingly
named <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> file using a <SAMP>`cc -c'</SAMP> command.  For example, it will
use the command <SAMP>`cc -c main.c -o main.o'</SAMP> to compile <TT>`main.c'</TT> into
<TT>`main.o'</TT>.  We can therefore omit the commands from the rules for the
object files.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC93">Using Implicit Rules</A>.
</P>
<P>
When a <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> file is used automatically in this way, it is also
automatically added to the list of prerequisites.  We can therefore omit
the <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> files from the prerequisites, provided we omit the commands.

</P>
<P>
Here is the entire example, with both of these changes, and a variable
<CODE>objects</CODE> as suggested above:

</P>

<PRE>
objects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
          insert.o search.o files.o utils.o

edit : $(objects)
        cc -o edit $(objects)

main.o : defs.h
kbd.o : defs.h command.h
command.o : defs.h command.h
display.o : defs.h buffer.h
insert.o : defs.h buffer.h
search.o : defs.h buffer.h
files.o : defs.h buffer.h command.h
utils.o : defs.h

.PHONY : clean
clean :

<P>
This is how we would write the makefile in actual practice.  (The
complications associated with <SAMP>`clean'</SAMP> are described elsewhere.

</P>
<P>
When the objects of a makefile are created only by implicit rules, an
alternative style of makefile is possible.  In this style of makefile,
you group entries by their prerequisites instead of by their targets.
Here is what one looks like:

</P>

<PRE>
objects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
          insert.o search.o files.o utils.o

edit : $(objects)
        cc -o edit $(objects)

$(objects) : defs.h
kbd.o command.o files.o : command.h
display.o insert.o search.o files.o : buffer.h
</PRE>

<P>
Here <TT>`defs.h'</TT> is given as a prerequisite of all the object files;
<TT>`command.h'</TT> and <TT>`buffer.h'</TT> are prerequisites of the specific
object files listed for them.

</P>
<P>
Whether this is better is a matter of taste: it is more compact, but some
people dislike it because they find it clearer to put all the information
about each target in one place.

</P>
<P>
Compiling a program is not the only thing you might want to write rules
for.  Makefiles commonly tell how to do a few other things besides
compiling a program: for example, how to delete all the object files
and executables so that the directory is <SAMP>`clean'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX47"></A>
Here is how we
could write a <CODE>make</CODE> rule for cleaning our example editor:

</P>

<PRE>
clean:
        rm edit $(objects)
</PRE>

<P>
In practice, we might want to write the rule in a somewhat more
complicated manner to handle unanticipated situations.  We would do this:

</P>

<PRE>
.PHONY : clean
clean :
        -rm edit $(objects)
</PRE>

<P>
This prevents <CODE>make</CODE> from getting confused by an actual file
called <TT>`clean'</TT> and causes it to continue in spite of errors from
<CODE>rm</CODE>.  (See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC33">Phony Targets</A>, and section <A HREF="make.html#SEC48">Errors in Commands</A>.)

</P>
<P>
A rule such as this should not be placed at the beginning of the
makefile, because we do not want it to run by default!  Thus, in the
example makefile, we want the rule for <CODE>edit</CODE>, which recompiles
the editor, to remain the default goal.

</P>
<P>
Since <CODE>clean</CODE> is not a prerequisite of <CODE>edit</CODE>, this rule will not
run at all if we give the command <SAMP>`make'</SAMP> with no arguments.  In
order to make the rule run, we have to type <SAMP>`make clean'</SAMP>.

length in later chapters.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX49"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX50"></A>
 
An <STRONG>explicit rule</STRONG> says when and how to remake one or more files,
called the rule's targets.  It lists the other files that the targets
depend on, call the <STRONG>prerequisites</STRONG> of the target, and may also give
commands to use to create or update the targets.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC20">Writing Rules</A>.

<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
<LI>

An <STRONG>implicit rule</STRONG> says when and how to remake a class of files
based on their names.  It describes how a target may depend on a file
with a name similar to the target and gives commands to create or
update such a target.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC93">Using Implicit Rules</A>.

<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
<LI>

A <STRONG>variable definition</STRONG> is a line that specifies a text string
value for a variable that can be substituted into the text later.  The
simple makefile example shows a variable definition for <CODE>objects</CODE>
as a list of all object files (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC8">Variables Make Makefiles Simpler</A>).

<A NAME="IDX54"></A>
<LI>

A <STRONG>directive</STRONG> is a command for <CODE>make</CODE> to do something special while
reading the makefile.  These include:


<UL>
<LI>

Reading another makefile (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC15">Including Other Makefiles</A>).

<LI>

Deciding (based on the values of variables) whether to use or
ignore a part of the makefile (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC71">Conditional Parts of Makefiles</A>).

Defining a variable from a verbatim string containing multiple lines

</UL>

<A NAME="IDX55"></A>

<SAMP>`#'</SAMP> in a line of a makefile starts a <STRONG>comment</STRONG>.  It and the rest of
the line are ignored, except that a trailing backslash not escaped by
another backslash will continue the comment across multiple lines.
Comments may appear on any of the lines in the makefile, except within a
<CODE>define</CODE> directive, and perhaps within commands (where the shell
decides what is a comment).  A line containing just a comment (with
perhaps spaces before it) is effectively blank, and is ignored.</UL>

<A NAME="IDX62"></A>
<A NAME="IDX63"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX64"></A>
Normally you should call your makefile either <TT>`makefile'</TT> or
<TT>`Makefile'</TT>.  (We recommend <TT>`Makefile'</TT> because it appears
prominently near the beginning of a directory listing, right near other
important files such as <TT>`README'</TT>.)  The first name checked,
<TT>`GNUmakefile'</TT>, is not recommended for most makefiles.  You should
use this name if you have a makefile that is specific to GNU
<CODE>make</CODE>, and will not be understood by other versions of
<CODE>make</CODE>.  Other <CODE>make</CODE> programs look for <TT>`makefile'</TT> and
<TT>`Makefile'</TT>, but not <TT>`GNUmakefile'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>make</CODE> finds none of these names, it does not use any makefile.
Then you must specify a goal with a command argument, and <CODE>make</CODE>
will attempt to figure out how to remake it using only its built-in
implicit rules.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC93">Using Implicit Rules</A>.

If you want to use a nonstandard name for your makefile, you can specify
the makefile name with the <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--file'</SAMP> option.  The
arguments <SAMP>`-f <VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--file=<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP> tell
<CODE>make</CODE> to read the file <VAR>name</VAR> as the makefile.  If you use
more than one <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--file'</SAMP> option, you can specify several
makefiles.  All the makefiles are effectively concatenated in the order
specified.  The default makefile names <TT>`GNUmakefile'</TT>,
<TT>`makefile'</TT> and <TT>`Makefile'</TT> are not checked automatically if you

<A NAME="IDX74"></A>
The <CODE>include</CODE> directive tells <CODE>make</CODE> to suspend reading the
current makefile and read one or more other makefiles before continuing.
The directive is a line in the makefile that looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
include <VAR>filenames</VAR>...
</PRE>

<P>
<VAR>filenames</VAR> can contain shell file name patterns.
<A NAME="IDX75"></A>
<A NAME="IDX76"></A>
<A NAME="IDX77"></A>

</P>
<P>
Extra spaces are allowed and ignored at the beginning of the line, but
a tab is not allowed.  (If the line begins with a tab, it will be
considered a command line.)  Whitespace is required between
<CODE>include</CODE> and the file names, and between file names; extra
whitespace is ignored there and at the end of the directive.  A
comment starting with <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> is allowed at the end of the line.  If
the file names contain any variable or function references, they are
expanded.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC57">How to Use Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
For example, if you have three <TT>`.mk'</TT> files, <TT>`a.mk'</TT>,
<TT>`b.mk'</TT>, and <TT>`c.mk'</TT>, and <CODE>$(bar)</CODE> expands to
<CODE>bish bash</CODE>, then the following expression

</P>

<PRE>
include foo *.mk $(bar)
</PRE>

<P>
is equivalent to

</P>

<PRE>
include foo a.mk b.mk c.mk bish bash
</PRE>

<P>
When <CODE>make</CODE> processes an <CODE>include</CODE> directive, it suspends
reading of the containing makefile and reads from each listed file in
turn.  When that is finished, <CODE>make</CODE> resumes reading the
makefile in which the directive appears.

</P>
<P>
One occasion for using <CODE>include</CODE> directives is when several programs,
handled by individual makefiles in various directories, need to use a
common set of variable definitions
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC64">Setting Variables</A>) or pattern rules
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC98">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</A>).

</P>
<P>
Another such occasion is when you want to generate prerequisites from
source files automatically; the prerequisites can be put in a file that
is included by the main makefile.  This practice is generally cleaner
than that of somehow appending the prerequisites to the end of the main
makefile as has been traditionally done with other versions of
<CODE>make</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC43">Generating Prerequisites Automatically</A>.

If the specified name does not start with a slash, and the file is not
found in the current directory, several other directories are searched.
First, any directories you have specified with the <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--include-dir'</SAMP> option are searched
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC92">Summary of Options</A>).
Then the following directories (if they exist)
are searched, in this order:
<TT>`<VAR>prefix</VAR>/include'</TT> (normally <TT>`/usr/local/include'</TT>
<A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="make.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>)
<TT>`/usr/gnu/include'</TT>,
<TT>`/usr/local/include'</TT>, <TT>`/usr/include'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If an included makefile cannot be found in any of these directories, a
warning message is generated, but it is not an immediately fatal error;
processing of the makefile containing the <CODE>include</CODE> continues.
Once it has finished reading makefiles, <CODE>make</CODE> will try to remake
any that are out of date or don't exist.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC17">How Makefiles Are Remade</A>.
Only after it has tried to find a way to remake a makefile and failed,
will <CODE>make</CODE> diagnose the missing makefile as a fatal error.

</P>
<P>
If you want <CODE>make</CODE> to simply ignore a makefile which does not exist
and cannot be remade, with no error message, use the <CODE>-include</CODE>
directive instead of <CODE>include</CODE>, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
-include <VAR>filenames</VAR>...
</PRE>

<P>
This is acts like <CODE>include</CODE> in every way except that there is no
error (not even a warning) if any of the <VAR>filenames</VAR> do not exist.
For compatibility with some other <CODE>make</CODE> implementations,
<CODE>sinclude</CODE> is another name for <CODE>-include</CODE>.

The main use of <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> is in communication between recursive
invocations of <CODE>make</CODE> (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC50">Recursive Use of <CODE>make</CODE></A>).  It usually is not desirable to set the environment
variable before a top-level invocation of <CODE>make</CODE>, because it is
usually better not to mess with a makefile from outside.  However, if
you are running <CODE>make</CODE> without a specific makefile, a makefile in
<CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> can do useful things to help the built-in implicit
rules work better, such as defining search paths (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC26">Searching Directories for Prerequisites</A>).

</P>
<P>
Some users are tempted to set <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> in the environment
automatically on login, and program makefiles to expect this to be done.
This is a very bad idea, because such makefiles will fail to work if run by
anyone else.  It is much better to write explicit <CODE>include</CODE> directives
in the makefiles.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC15">Including Other Makefiles</A>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="make.html#TOC17">How Makefiles Are Remade</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX92"></A>
<A NAME="IDX93"></A>
<A NAME="IDX94"></A>
Sometimes makefiles can be remade from other files, such as RCS or SCCS
files.  If a makefile can be remade from other files, you probably want
<CODE>make</CODE> to get an up-to-date version of the makefile to read in.

</P>
<P>
To this end, after reading in all makefiles, <CODE>make</CODE> will consider
each as a goal target and attempt to update it.  If a makefile has a
rule which says how to update it (found either in that very makefile or
in another one) or if an implicit rule applies to it (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC93">Using Implicit Rules</A>), it will be updated if necessary.  After
all makefiles have been checked, if any have actually been changed,
<CODE>make</CODE> starts with a clean slate and reads all the makefiles over
again.  (It will also attempt to update each of them over again, but
normally this will not change them again, since they are already up to
date.)
</P>
<P>
If you know that one or more of your makefiles cannot be remade and you
want to keep <CODE>make</CODE> from performing an implicit rule search on
them, perhaps for efficiency reasons, you can use any normal method of
preventing implicit rule lookup to do so.  For example, you can write an
explicit rule with the makefile as the target, and an empty command
string (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC56">Using Empty Commands</A>).

</P>
<P>
If the makefiles specify a double-colon rule to remake a file with
commands but no prerequisites, that file will always be remade
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC42">Double-Colon Rules</A>).  In the case of makefiles, a makefile that has a
double-colon rule with commands but no prerequisites will be remade every
time <CODE>make</CODE> is run, and then again after <CODE>make</CODE> starts over
and reads the makefiles in again.  This would cause an infinite loop:
<CODE>make</CODE> would constantly remake the makefile, and never do anything
else.  So, to avoid this, <CODE>make</CODE> will <STRONG>not</STRONG> attempt to
remake makefiles which are specified as targets of a double-colon rule
with commands but no prerequisites.
</P>
<P>
If you do not specify any makefiles to be read with <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--file'</SAMP> options, <CODE>make</CODE> will try the default makefile names;
see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC14">What Name to Give Your Makefile</A>.  Unlike
makefiles explicitly requested with <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--file'</SAMP> options,
<CODE>make</CODE> is not certain that these makefiles should exist.  However,
if a default makefile does not exist but can be created by running
<CODE>make</CODE> rules, you probably want the rules to be run so that the
makefile can be used.

</P>
<P>
Therefore, if none of the default makefiles exists, <CODE>make</CODE> will try
to make each of them in the same order in which they are searched for
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC14">What Name to Give Your Makefile</A>)
until it succeeds in making one, or it runs out of names to try.  Note
that it is not an error if <CODE>make</CODE> cannot find or make any makefile;
a makefile is not always necessary.
</P>
<P>
When you use the <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--touch'</SAMP> option
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC88">Instead of Executing the Commands</A>),
you would not want to use an out-of-date makefile to decide which
targets to touch.  So the <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> option has no effect on updating
makefiles; they are really updated even if <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> is specified.
Likewise, <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP> (or <SAMP>`--question'</SAMP>) and <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP> (or
<SAMP>`--just-print'</SAMP>) do not prevent updating of makefiles, because an
out-of-date makefile would result in the wrong output for other targets.
Thus, <SAMP>`make -f mfile -n foo'</SAMP> will update <TT>`mfile'</TT>, read it in,
and then print the commands to update <TT>`foo'</TT> and its prerequisites
without running them.  The commands printed for <TT>`foo'</TT> will be those
specified in the updated contents of <TT>`mfile'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
However, on occasion you might actually wish to prevent updating of even
the makefiles.  You can do this by specifying the makefiles as goals in
the command line as well as specifying them as makefiles.  When the
makefile name is specified explicitly as a goal, the options <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP>
and so on do apply to them.

</P>
<P>
Thus, <SAMP>`make -f mfile -n mfile foo'</SAMP> would read the makefile
<TT>`mfile'</TT>, print the commands needed to update it without actually
running them, and then print the commands needed to update <TT>`foo'</TT>
without running them.  The commands for <TT>`foo'</TT> will be those
specified by the existing contents of <TT>`mfile'</TT>.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX95"></A>
<A NAME="IDX96"></A>
Sometimes it is useful to have a makefile that is mostly just like
another makefile.  You can often use the <SAMP>`include'</SAMP> directive to
include one in the other, and add more targets or variable definitions.
However, if the two makefiles give different commands for the same
target, <CODE>make</CODE> will not let you just do this.  But there is another way.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX97"></A>
In the containing makefile (the one that wants to include the other),
you can use a match-anything pattern rule to say that to remake any
target that cannot be made from the information in the containing
makefile, <CODE>make</CODE> should look in another makefile.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC98">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</A>, for more information on pattern rules.

</P>
<P>
For example, if you have a makefile called <TT>`Makefile'</TT> that says how
to make the target <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> (and other targets), you can write a
makefile called <TT>`GNUmakefile'</TT> that contains:

</P>

<PRE>
foo:
        frobnicate &#62; foo

%: force
        @$(MAKE) -f Makefile $@
force: ;
</PRE>

<P>
If you say <SAMP>`make foo'</SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE> will find <TT>`GNUmakefile'</TT>,
read it, and see that to make <TT>`foo'</TT>, it needs to run the command
<SAMP>`frobnicate &#62; foo'</SAMP>.  If you say <SAMP>`make bar'</SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE> will
find no way to make <TT>`bar'</TT> in <TT>`GNUmakefile'</TT>, so it will use the
commands from the pattern rule: <SAMP>`make -f Makefile bar'</SAMP>.  If
<TT>`Makefile'</TT> provides a rule for updating <TT>`bar'</TT>, <CODE>make</CODE>
will apply the rule.  And likewise for any other target that
<TT>`GNUmakefile'</TT> does not say how to make.

</P>
<P>
The way this works is that the pattern rule has a pattern of just
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP>, so it matches any target whatever.  The rule specifies a
prerequisite <TT>`force'</TT>, to guarantee that the commands will be run even
if the target file already exists.  We give <TT>`force'</TT> target empty
commands to prevent <CODE>make</CODE> from searching for an implicit rule to
build it--otherwise it would apply the same match-anything rule to
<TT>`force'</TT> itself and create a prerequisite loop!

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX98"></A>
<A NAME="IDX99"></A>

</P>
<P>
GNU <CODE>make</CODE> does its work in two distinct phases.  During the first
phase it reads all the makefiles, included makefiles, etc. and
internalizes all the variables and their values, implicit and explicit
rules, and constructs a dependency graph of all the targets and their
prerequisites.  During the second phase, <CODE>make</CODE> uses these internal
structures to determine what targets will need to be rebuilt and to
invoke the rules necessary to do so.

</P>
<P>
It's important to understand this two-phase approach because it has a
direct impact on how variable and function expansion happens; this is
often a source of some confusion when writing makefiles.  Here we will
present a summary of the phases in which expansion happens for different
constructs within the makefile.  We say that expansion is
<STRONG>immediate</STRONG> if it happens during the first phase: in this case
<CODE>make</CODE> will expand any variables or functions in that section of a
construct as the makefile is parsed.  We say that expansion is
<STRONG>deferred</STRONG> if expansion is not performed immediately.  Expansion of
deferred construct is not performed until either the construct appears
later in an immediate context, or until the second phase.

</P>
<P>
You may not be familiar with some of these constructs yet.  You can
reference this section as you become familiar with them, in later
chapters.

Variable definitions are parsed as follows:

<PRE>
<VAR>immediate</VAR> = <VAR>deferred</VAR>
<VAR>immediate</VAR> ?= <VAR>deferred</VAR>
<VAR>immediate</VAR> := <VAR>immediate</VAR>
<VAR>immediate</VAR> += <VAR>deferred</VAR> or <VAR>immediate</VAR>

define <VAR>immediate</VAR>
  <VAR>deferred</VAR>
endef
</PRE>

<P>
For the append operator, <SAMP>`+='</SAMP>, the right-hand side is considered
immediate if the variable was previously set as a simple variable
(<SAMP>`:='</SAMP>), and deferred otherwise.

A rule is always expanded the same way, regardless of the form:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>immediate</VAR> : <VAR>immediate</VAR> ; <VAR>deferred</VAR>
	<VAR>deferred</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
That is, the target and prerequisite sections are expanded immediately,
and the commands used to construct the target are always deferred.  This
general rule is true for explicit rules, pattern rules, suffix rules,
static pattern rules, and simple prerequisite definitions.

A <STRONG>rule</STRONG> appears in the makefile and says when and how to remake
certain files, called the rule's <STRONG>targets</STRONG> (most often only one per rule).
It lists the other files that are the <STRONG>prerequisites</STRONG> of the target, and
<STRONG>commands</STRONG> to use to create or update the target.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX118"></A>
<A NAME="IDX119"></A>
The order of rules is not significant, except for determining the
<STRONG>default goal</STRONG>: the target for <CODE>make</CODE> to consider, if you do
not otherwise specify one.  The default goal is the target of the first
rule in the first makefile.  If the first rule has multiple targets,
only the first target is taken as the default.  There are two
exceptions: a target starting with a period is not a default unless it
contains one or more slashes, <SAMP>`/'</SAMP>, as well; and, a target that
defines a pattern rule has no effect on the default goal.
(See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC98">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</A>.)

</P>
<P>
Therefore, we usually write the makefile so that the first rule is the
one for compiling the entire program or all the programs described by
the makefile (often with a target called <SAMP>`all'</SAMP>).
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC87">Arguments to Specify the Goals</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX120"></A>
<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
In general, a rule looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>targets</VAR> : <VAR>prerequisites</VAR>
        <VAR>command</VAR>
        ...
</PRE>

<P>
or like this:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>targets</VAR> : <VAR>prerequisites</VAR> ; <VAR>command</VAR>
        <VAR>command</VAR>
        ...
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
The <VAR>targets</VAR> are file names, separated by spaces.  Wildcard
characters may be used (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC22">Using Wildcard Characters in File Names</A>) and a name of the form <TT>`<VAR>a</VAR>(<VAR>m</VAR>)'</TT>
represents member <VAR>m</VAR> in archive file <VAR>a</VAR>
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC109">Archive Members as Targets</A>).
Usually there is only one
target per rule, but occasionally there is a reason to have more
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC37">Multiple Targets in a Rule</A>).
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
<A NAME="IDX125"></A>
The <VAR>command</VAR> lines start with a tab character.  The first command may
appear on the line after the prerequisites, with a tab character, or may
appear on the same line, with a semicolon.  Either way, the effect is the
same.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC44">Writing the Commands in Rules</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX126"></A>
<A NAME="IDX127"></A>

Because dollar signs are used to start variable references, if you really
want a dollar sign in a rule you must write two of them, <SAMP>`$$'</SAMP>
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC57">How to Use Variables</A>).
You may split a long line by inserting a backslash
followed by a newline, but this is not required, as <CODE>make</CODE> places no
limit on the length of a line in a makefile.

</P>
<P>
A rule tells <CODE>make</CODE> two things: when the targets are out of date,
and how to update them when necessary.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX129"></A>
<A NAME="IDX130"></A>
The criterion for being out of date is specified in terms of the
<VAR>prerequisites</VAR>, which consist of file names separated by spaces.
(Wildcards and archive members (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC108">Using <CODE>make</CODE> to Update Archive Files</A>) are allowed here too.)
A target is out of date if it does not exist or if it is older than any
of the prerequisites (by comparison of last-modification times).  The
idea is that the contents of the target file are computed based on
information in the prerequisites, so if any of the prerequisites changes,
the contents of the existing target file are no longer necessarily
valid.

</P>
<P>
How to update is specified by <VAR>commands</VAR>.  These are lines to be
executed by the shell (normally <SAMP>`sh'</SAMP>), but with some extra features
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC44">Writing the Commands in Rules</A>).

<A NAME="IDX135"></A>
<A NAME="IDX136"></A>
A single file name can specify many files using <STRONG>wildcard characters</STRONG>.
The wildcard characters in <CODE>make</CODE> are <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`?'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`[...]'</SAMP>, the same as in the Bourne shell.  For example, <TT>`*.c'</TT>
specifies a list of all the files (in the working directory) whose names
end in <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP>.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX137"></A>
<A NAME="IDX138"></A>
<A NAME="IDX139"></A>
The character <SAMP>`~'</SAMP> at the beginning of a file name also has special
significance.  If alone, or followed by a slash, it represents your home
directory.  For example <TT>`~/bin'</TT> expands to <TT>`/home/you/bin'</TT>.
If the <SAMP>`~'</SAMP> is followed by a word, the string represents the home
directory of the user named by that word.  For example <TT>`~john/bin'</TT>
expands to <TT>`/home/john/bin'</TT>.  On systems which don't have a home
directory for each user (such as MS-DOS or MS-Windows), this
functionality can be simulated by setting the environment variable
<VAR>HOME</VAR>.
</P>
<P>
Wildcard expansion happens automatically in targets, in prerequisites,
and in commands (where the shell does the expansion).  In other
contexts, wildcard expansion happens only if you request it explicitly
with the <CODE>wildcard</CODE> function.

</P>
<P>
The special significance of a wildcard character can be turned off by
preceding it with a backslash.  Thus, <TT>`foo\*bar'</TT> would refer to a
specific file whose name consists of <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP>, an asterisk, and
<SAMP>`bar'</SAMP>.
</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="make.html#TOC23">Wildcard Examples</A></H3>

<P>
Wildcards can be used in the commands of a rule, where they are expanded
by the shell.  For example, here is a rule to delete all the object files:

</P>

<PRE>
clean:
        rm -f *.o
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX140"></A>

</P>
<P>
Wildcards are also useful in the prerequisites of a rule.  With the
following rule in the makefile, <SAMP>`make print'</SAMP> will print all the
<SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> files that have changed since the last time you printed them:

</P>

<PRE>
print: *.c
        lpr -p $?
        touch print
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX141"></A>
<A NAME="IDX142"></A>
<A NAME="IDX143"></A>
This rule uses <TT>`print'</TT> as an empty target file; see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC35">Empty Target Files to Record Events</A>.  (The automatic variable
<SAMP>`$?'</SAMP> is used to print only those files that have changed; see
section <A HREF="make.html#SEC101">Automatic Variables</A>.)
</P>
<P>
Wildcard expansion does not happen when you define a variable.  Thus, if
you write this:

</P>

<PRE>
objects = *.o
</PRE>

<P>
then the value of the variable <CODE>objects</CODE> is the actual string
<SAMP>`*.o'</SAMP>.  However, if you use the value of <CODE>objects</CODE> in a target,
prerequisite or command, wildcard expansion will take place at that time.
To set <CODE>objects</CODE> to the expansion, instead use:

</P>

<PRE>
objects := $(wildcard *.o)
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC25">The Function <CODE>wildcard</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
Now here is an example of a naive way of using wildcard expansion, that
does not do what you would intend.  Suppose you would like to say that the
executable file <TT>`foo'</TT> is made from all the object files in the
directory, and you write this:

</P>

<PRE>
objects = *.o

foo : $(objects)
        cc -o foo $(CFLAGS) $(objects)
</PRE>

<P>
The value of <CODE>objects</CODE> is the actual string <SAMP>`*.o'</SAMP>.  Wildcard
expansion happens in the rule for <TT>`foo'</TT>, so that each <EM>existing</EM>
<SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> file becomes a prerequisite of <TT>`foo'</TT> and will be recompiled if
necessary.

</P>
<P>
But what if you delete all the <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> files?  When a wildcard matches
no files, it is left as it is, so then <TT>`foo'</TT> will depend on the
oddly-named file <TT>`*.o'</TT>.  Since no such file is likely to exist,
<CODE>make</CODE> will give you an error saying it cannot figure out how to
make <TT>`*.o'</TT>.  This is not what you want!

</P>
<P>
Actually it is possible to obtain the desired result with wildcard
expansion, but you need more sophisticated techniques, including the
<CODE>wildcard</CODE> function and string substitution.
These are described in the following section.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX149"></A>
<A NAME="IDX150"></A>

</P>
<P>
Microsoft operating systems (MS-DOS and MS-Windows) use backslashes to
separate directories in pathnames, like so:

</P>

<PRE>
  c:\foo\bar\baz.c
</PRE>

<P>
This is equivalent to the Unix-style <TT>`c:/foo/bar/baz.c'</TT> (the
<TT>`c:'</TT> part is the so-called drive letter).  When <CODE>make</CODE> runs on
these systems, it supports backslashes as well as the Unix-style forward
slashes in pathnames.  However, this support does <EM>not</EM> include the
wildcard expansion, where backslash is a quote character.  Therefore,
you <EM>must</EM> use Unix-style slashes in these cases.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="make.html#TOC25">The Function <CODE>wildcard</CODE></A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX151"></A>

</P>
<P>
Wildcard expansion happens automatically in rules.  But wildcard expansion
does not normally take place when a variable is set, or inside the
arguments of a function.  If you want to do wildcard expansion in such
places, you need to use the <CODE>wildcard</CODE> function, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
$(wildcard <VAR>pattern</VAR>...)
</PRE>

<P>
This string, used anywhere in a makefile, is replaced by a
space-separated list of names of existing files that match one of the
given file name patterns.  If no existing file name matches a pattern,
then that pattern is omitted from the output of the <CODE>wildcard</CODE>
function.  Note that this is different from how unmatched wildcards
behave in rules, where they are used verbatim rather than ignored
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC24">Pitfalls of Using Wildcards</A>).

</P>
<P>
One use of the <CODE>wildcard</CODE> function is to get a list of all the C source
files in a directory, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
$(wildcard *.c)
</PRE>

<P>
We can change the list of C source files into a list of object files by
replacing the <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> suffix with <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> in the result, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
$(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))
</PRE>

<P>
(Here we have used another function, <CODE>patsubst</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC77">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</A>.)
</P>
<P>
Thus, a makefile to compile all C source files in the directory and then
link them together could be written as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
objects := $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))

foo : $(objects)

<P>
For large systems, it is often desirable to put sources in a separate
directory from the binaries.  The <STRONG>directory search</STRONG> features of
<CODE>make</CODE> facilitate this by searching several directories
automatically to find a prerequisite.  When you redistribute the files
among directories, you do not need to change the individual rules,
just the search paths.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="make.html#TOC27"><CODE>VPATH</CODE>: Search Path for All Prerequisites</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX157"></A>

</P>
<P>
The value of the <CODE>make</CODE> variable <CODE>VPATH</CODE> specifies a list of
directories that <CODE>make</CODE> should search.  Most often, the
directories are expected to contain prerequisite files that are not in the
current directory; however, <CODE>VPATH</CODE> specifies a search list that
<CODE>make</CODE> applies for all files, including files which are targets of
rules.

</P>
<P>
Thus, if a file that is listed as a target or prerequisite does not exist
in the current directory, <CODE>make</CODE> searches the directories listed in
<CODE>VPATH</CODE> for a file with that name.  If a file is found in one of
them, that file may become the prerequisite (see below).  Rules may then
specify the names of files in the prerequisite list as if they all
existed in the current directory.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC30">Writing Shell Commands with Directory Search</A>.

</P>
<P>
In the <CODE>VPATH</CODE> variable, directory names are separated by colons or
blanks.  The order in which directories are listed is the order followed
by <CODE>make</CODE> in its search.  (On MS-DOS and MS-Windows, semi-colons
are used as separators of directory names in <CODE>VPATH</CODE>, since the
colon can be used in the pathname itself, after the drive letter.)

</P>
<P>
For example,

</P>

<PRE>
VPATH = src:../headers
</PRE>

<P>
specifies a path containing two directories, <TT>`src'</TT> and
<TT>`../headers'</TT>, which <CODE>make</CODE> searches in that order.

</P>
<P>
With this value of <CODE>VPATH</CODE>, the following rule,

</P>

<PRE>
foo.o : foo.c
</PRE>

<P>
is interpreted as if it were written like this:

</P>

<PRE>
foo.o : src/foo.c
</PRE>

<P>
assuming the file <TT>`foo.c'</TT> does not exist in the current directory but
is found in the directory <TT>`src'</TT>.

<H3><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="make.html#TOC28">The <CODE>vpath</CODE> Directive</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX158"></A>

</P>
<P>
Similar to the <CODE>VPATH</CODE> variable, but more selective, is the
<CODE>vpath</CODE> directive (note lower case), which allows you to specify a
search path for a particular class of file names: those that match a
particular pattern.  Thus you can supply certain search directories for
one class of file names and other directories (or none) for other file
names.

</P>
<P>
There are three forms of the <CODE>vpath</CODE> directive:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>vpath <VAR>pattern</VAR> <VAR>directories</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Specify the search path <VAR>directories</VAR> for file names that match
<VAR>pattern</VAR>.

The search path, <VAR>directories</VAR>, is a list of directories to be
searched, separated by colons (semi-colons on MS-DOS and MS-Windows) or
blanks, just like the search path used in the <CODE>VPATH</CODE> variable.

<DT><CODE>vpath <VAR>pattern</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Clear out the search path associated with <VAR>pattern</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>vpath</CODE>
<DD>
Clear all search paths previously specified with <CODE>vpath</CODE> directives.
</DL>

<P>
A <CODE>vpath</CODE> pattern is a string containing a <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> character.  The
string must match the file name of a prerequisite that is being searched
for, the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> character matching any sequence of zero or more
characters (as in pattern rules; see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC98">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</A>).  For example, <CODE>%.h</CODE> matches files that
end in <CODE>.h</CODE>.  (If there is no <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>, the pattern must match the
prerequisite exactly, which is not useful very often.)

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX159"></A>
<A NAME="IDX160"></A>
<A NAME="IDX161"></A>
<A NAME="IDX162"></A>
<A NAME="IDX163"></A>
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters in a <CODE>vpath</CODE> directive's pattern can be quoted
with preceding backslashes (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>).  Backslashes that would otherwise
quote <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters can be quoted with more backslashes.
Backslashes that quote <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters or other backslashes are
removed from the pattern before it is compared to file names.  Backslashes
that are not in danger of quoting <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters go unmolested.
</P>
<P>
When a prerequisite fails to exist in the current directory, if the
<VAR>pattern</VAR> in a <CODE>vpath</CODE> directive matches the name of the
prerequisite file, then the <VAR>directories</VAR> in that directive are searched
just like (and before) the directories in the <CODE>VPATH</CODE> variable.

</P>
<P>
For example,

</P>

<PRE>
vpath %.h ../headers
</PRE>

<P>
tells <CODE>make</CODE> to look for any prerequisite whose name ends in <TT>`.h'</TT>
in the directory <TT>`../headers'</TT> if the file is not found in the current
directory.

</P>
<P>
If several <CODE>vpath</CODE> patterns match the prerequisite file's name, then
<CODE>make</CODE> processes each matching <CODE>vpath</CODE> directive one by one,
searching all the directories mentioned in each directive.  <CODE>make</CODE>
handles multiple <CODE>vpath</CODE> directives in the order in which they
appear in the makefile; multiple directives with the same pattern are
independent of each other.

</P>
<P>
Thus,

</P>

<PRE>
vpath %.c foo
vpath %   blish
vpath %.c bar
</PRE>

<P>
will look for a file ending in <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> in <TT>`foo'</TT>, then
<TT>`blish'</TT>, then <TT>`bar'</TT>, while

</P>

<PRE>
vpath %.c foo:bar
vpath %   blish
</PRE>

<P>
will look for a file ending in <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> in <TT>`foo'</TT>, then
<TT>`bar'</TT>, then <TT>`blish'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
When a prerequisite is found through directory search, regardless of type
(general or selective), the pathname located may not be the one that
<CODE>make</CODE> actually provides you in the prerequisite list.  Sometimes
the path discovered through directory search is thrown away.

</P>
<P>
The algorithm <CODE>make</CODE> uses to decide whether to keep or abandon a
path found via directory search is as follows:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

If a target file does not exist at the path specified in the makefile,
directory search is performed.

<LI>

If the directory search is successful, that path is kept and this file
is tentatively stored as the target.

<LI>

All prerequisites of this target are examined using this same method.

<LI>

After processing the prerequisites, the target may or may not need to be
rebuilt:


<OL>
<LI>

If the target does <EM>not</EM> need to be rebuilt, the path to the file
found during directory search is used for any prerequisite lists which
contain this target.  In short, if <CODE>make</CODE> doesn't need to rebuild
the target then you use the path found via directory search.

<LI>

If the target <EM>does</EM> need to be rebuilt (is out-of-date), the
pathname found during directory search is <EM>thrown away</EM>, and the
target is rebuilt using the file name specified in the makefile.  In
short, if <CODE>make</CODE> must rebuild, then the target is rebuilt locally,
not in the directory found via directory search.
</OL>

</OL>

<P>
This algorithm may seem complex, but in practice it is quite often
exactly what you want.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX166"></A>
<A NAME="IDX167"></A>
Other versions of <CODE>make</CODE> use a simpler algorithm: if the file does
not exist, and it is found via directory search, then that pathname is
always used whether or not the target needs to be built.  Thus, if the
target is rebuilt it is created at the pathname discovered during
directory search.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX168"></A>
If, in fact, this is the behavior you want for some or all of your
directories, you can use the <CODE>GPATH</CODE> variable to indicate this to
<CODE>make</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>GPATH</CODE> has the same syntax and format as <CODE>VPATH</CODE> (that is, a
space- or colon-delimited list of pathnames).  If an out-of-date target
is found by directory search in a directory that also appears in
<CODE>GPATH</CODE>, then that pathname is not thrown away.  The target is
rebuilt using the expanded path.

When a prerequisite is found in another directory through directory search,
this cannot change the commands of the rule; they will execute as written.
Therefore, you must write the commands with care so that they will look for
the prerequisite in the directory where <CODE>make</CODE> finds it.

</P>
<P>
This is done with the <STRONG>automatic variables</STRONG> such as <SAMP>`$^'</SAMP>
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC101">Automatic Variables</A>).
For instance, the value of <SAMP>`$^'</SAMP> is a
list of all the prerequisites of the rule, including the names of
the directories in which they were found, and the value of
<SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> is the target.  Thus:
</P>

<PRE>
foo.o : foo.c
        cc -c $(CFLAGS) $^ -o $@
</PRE>

<P>
(The variable <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> exists so you can specify flags for C
compilation by implicit rules; we use it here for consistency so it will
affect all C compilations uniformly;
see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC96">Variables Used by Implicit Rules</A>.)

</P>
<P>
Often the prerequisites include header files as well, which you do not
want to mention in the commands.  The automatic variable <SAMP>`$&#60;'</SAMP> is
just the first prerequisite:

</P>

<PRE>
VPATH = src:../headers
foo.o : foo.c defs.h hack.h
        cc -c $(CFLAGS) $&#60; -o $@

The search through the directories specified in <CODE>VPATH</CODE> or with
<CODE>vpath</CODE> also happens during consideration of implicit rules
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC93">Using Implicit Rules</A>).

</P>
<P>
For example, when a file <TT>`foo.o'</TT> has no explicit rule, <CODE>make</CODE>
considers implicit rules, such as the built-in rule to compile
<TT>`foo.c'</TT> if that file exists.  If such a file is lacking in the
current directory, the appropriate directories are searched for it.  If
<TT>`foo.c'</TT> exists (or is mentioned in the makefile) in any of the
directories, the implicit rule for C compilation is applied.

<P>
The commands of implicit rules normally use automatic variables as a
matter of necessity; consequently they will use the file names found by
directory search with no extra effort.

Directory search applies in a special way to libraries used with the
linker.  This special feature comes into play when you write a prerequisite
whose name is of the form <SAMP>`-l<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP>.  (You can tell something
strange is going on here because the prerequisite is normally the name of a
file, and the <EM>file name</EM> of a library generally looks like
<TT>`lib<VAR>name</VAR>.a'</TT>, not like <SAMP>`-l<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP>.)
</P>
<P>
When a prerequisite's name has the form <SAMP>`-l<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE>
handles it specially by searching for the file <TT>`lib<VAR>name</VAR>.so'</TT> in
the current directory, in directories specified by matching <CODE>vpath</CODE>
search paths and the <CODE>VPATH</CODE> search path, and then in the
directories <TT>`/lib'</TT>, <TT>`/usr/lib'</TT>, and <TT>`<VAR>prefix</VAR>/lib'</TT>
(normally <TT>`/usr/local/lib'</TT>, but MS-DOS/MS-Windows versions of
<CODE>make</CODE> behave as if <VAR>prefix</VAR> is defined to be the root of the
DJGPP installation tree).

</P>
<P>
If that file is not found, then the file <TT>`lib<VAR>name</VAR>.a'</TT> is
searched for, in the same directories as above.

</P>
<P>
For example, if there is a <TT>`/usr/lib/libcurses.a'</TT> library on your
system (and no <TT>`/usr/lib/libcurses.so'</TT> file), then

</P>

<PRE>
foo : foo.c -lcurses
        cc $^ -o $@
</PRE>

<P>
would cause the command <SAMP>`cc foo.c /usr/lib/libcurses.a -o foo'</SAMP> to
be executed when <TT>`foo'</TT> is older than <TT>`foo.c'</TT> or than
<TT>`/usr/lib/libcurses.a'</TT>.
</P>
<P>
Although the default set of files to be searched for is
<TT>`lib<VAR>name</VAR>.so'</TT> and <TT>`lib<VAR>name</VAR>.a'</TT>, this is customizable
via the <CODE>.LIBPATTERNS</CODE> variable.  Each word in the value of this
variable is a pattern string.  When a prerequisite like
<SAMP>`-l<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP> is seen, <CODE>make</CODE> will replace the percent in
each pattern in the list with <VAR>name</VAR> and perform the above directory
searches using that library filename.  If no library is found, the next
word in the list will be used.

</P>
<P>
The default value for <CODE>.LIBPATTERNS</CODE> is "<SAMP>`lib%.so lib%.a'</SAMP>",
which provides the default behavior described above.

<P>
You can turn off link library expansion completely by setting this
variable to an empty value.

A phony target is one that is not really the name of a file.  It is just a
name for some commands to be executed when you make an explicit request.
There are two reasons to use a phony target: to avoid a conflict with
a file of the same name, and to improve performance.

</P>
<P>
If you write a rule whose commands will not create the target file, the
commands will be executed every time the target comes up for remaking.
Here is an example:

</P>

<PRE>
clean:
        rm *.o temp
</PRE>

<P>
Because the <CODE>rm</CODE> command does not create a file named <TT>`clean'</TT>,
probably no such file will ever exist.  Therefore, the <CODE>rm</CODE> command
will be executed every time you say <SAMP>`make clean'</SAMP>.
<A NAME="IDX190"></A>

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX191"></A>
The phony target will cease to work if anything ever does create a file
named <TT>`clean'</TT> in this directory.  Since it has no prerequisites, the
file <TT>`clean'</TT> would inevitably be considered up to date, and its
commands would not be executed.  To avoid this problem, you can explicitly
declare the target to be phony, using the special target <CODE>.PHONY</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC36">Special Built-in Target Names</A>) as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
.PHONY : clean
</PRE>

<P>
Once this is done, <SAMP>`make clean'</SAMP> will run the commands regardless of
whether there is a file named <TT>`clean'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
Since it knows that phony targets do not name actual files that could be
remade from other files, <CODE>make</CODE> skips the implicit rule search for
phony targets (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC93">Using Implicit Rules</A>).  This is why declaring a target
phony is good for performance, even if you are not worried about the
actual file existing.

</P>
<P>
Thus, you first write the line that states that <CODE>clean</CODE> is a
phony target, then you write the rule, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
.PHONY: clean
clean:
        rm *.o temp
</PRE>

<P>
Another example of the usefulness of phony targets is in conjunction
with recursive invocations of <CODE>make</CODE>.  In this case the makefile
will often contain a variable which lists a number of subdirectories to
be built.  One way to handle this is with one rule whose command is a
shell loop over the subdirectories, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
SUBDIRS = foo bar baz

subdirs:
        for dir in $(SUBDIRS); do \
          $(MAKE) -C $$dir; \
        done
</PRE>

<P>
There are a few of problems with this method, however.  First, any error
detected in a submake is not noted by this rule, so it will continue to
build the rest of the directories even when one fails.  This can be
overcome by adding shell commands to note the error and exit, but then
it will do so even if <CODE>make</CODE> is invoked with the <CODE>-k</CODE> option,
which is unfortunate.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, you cannot
take advantage of the parallel build capabilities of make using this
method, since there is only one rule.

</P>
<P>
By declaring the subdirectories as phony targets (you must do this as
the subdirectory obviously always exists; otherwise it won't be built)
you can remove these problems:

</P>

<PRE>
SUBDIRS = foo bar baz

.PHONY: subdirs $(SUBDIRS)

subdirs: $(SUBDIRS)

$(SUBDIRS):
        $(MAKE) -C $

foo: baz
</PRE>

<P>
Here we've also declared that the <TT>`foo'</TT> subdirectory cannot be
built until after the <TT>`baz'</TT> subdirectory is complete; this kind of
relationship declaration is particularly important when attempting
parallel builds.

</P>
<P>
A phony target should not be a prerequisite of a real target file; if it
is, its commands are run every time <CODE>make</CODE> goes to update that
file.  As long as a phony target is never a prerequisite of a real
target, the phony target commands will be executed only when the phony
target is a specified goal (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC87">Arguments to Specify the Goals</A>).

</P>
<P>
Phony targets can have prerequisites.  When one directory contains multiple
programs, it is most convenient to describe all of the programs in one
makefile <TT>`./Makefile'</TT>.  Since the target remade by default will be the
first one in the makefile, it is common to make this a phony target named
<SAMP>`all'</SAMP> and give it, as prerequisites, all the individual programs.  For
example:

</P>

<PRE>
all : prog1 prog2 prog3
.PHONY : all

prog1 : prog1.o utils.o
        cc -o prog1 prog1.o utils.o

prog2 : prog2.o
        cc -o prog2 prog2.o

prog3 : prog3.o sort.o utils.o
        cc -o prog3 prog3.o sort.o utils.o
</PRE>

<P>
Now you can say just <SAMP>`make'</SAMP> to remake all three programs, or specify
as arguments the ones to remake (as in <SAMP>`make prog1 prog3'</SAMP>).

</P>
<P>
When one phony target is a prerequisite of another, it serves as a subroutine
of the other.  For example, here <SAMP>`make cleanall'</SAMP> will delete the
object files, the difference files, and the file <TT>`program'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
.PHONY: cleanall cleanobj cleandiff

cleanall : cleanobj cleandiff
        rm program

cleanobj :
        rm *.o

cleandiff :
        rm *.diff
</PRE>

<P>
If a rule has no prerequisites or commands, and the target of the rule
is a nonexistent file, then <CODE>make</CODE> imagines this target to have
been updated whenever its rule is run.  This implies that all targets
depending on this one will always have their commands run.

</P>
<P>
An example will illustrate this:

</P>

<PRE>
clean: FORCE
        rm $(objects)
FORCE:
</PRE>

<P>
Here the target <SAMP>`FORCE'</SAMP> satisfies the special conditions, so the
target <TT>`clean'</TT> that depends on it is forced to run its commands.
There is nothing special about the name <SAMP>`FORCE'</SAMP>, but that is one name
commonly used this way.

</P>
<P>
As you can see, using <SAMP>`FORCE'</SAMP> this way has the same results as using
<SAMP>`.PHONY: clean'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Using <SAMP>`.PHONY'</SAMP> is more explicit and more efficient.  However,
other versions of <CODE>make</CODE> do not support <SAMP>`.PHONY'</SAMP>; thus
<SAMP>`FORCE'</SAMP> appears in many makefiles.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC33">Phony Targets</A>.

</P>
<P>
The <STRONG>empty target</STRONG> is a variant of the phony target; it is used to hold
commands for an action that you request explicitly from time to time.
Unlike a phony target, this target file can really exist; but the file's
contents do not matter, and usually are empty.

</P>
<P>
The purpose of the empty target file is to record, with its
last-modification time, when the rule's commands were last executed.  It
does so because one of the commands is a <CODE>touch</CODE> command to update the
target file.

</P>
<P>
The empty target file should have some prerequisites (otherwise it
doesn't make sense).  When you ask to remake the empty target, the
commands are executed if any prerequisite is more recent than the target;
in other words, if a prerequisite has changed since the last time you
remade the target.  Here is an example:

</P>

<PRE>
print: foo.c bar.c
        lpr -p $?
        touch print
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX199"></A>
<A NAME="IDX200"></A>
<A NAME="IDX201"></A>

</P>

The prerequisites of the special target <CODE>.PHONY</CODE> are considered to
be phony targets.  When it is time to consider such a target,
<CODE>make</CODE> will run its commands unconditionally, regardless of
whether a file with that name exists or what its last-modification
time is.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC33">Phony Targets</A>.

<A NAME="IDX206"></A>

<A NAME="IDX207"></A>
<DT><CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE>

The commands specified for <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> are used for any target for
which no rules are found (either explicit rules or implicit rules).
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC105">Defining Last-Resort Default Rules</A>.  If <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> commands are specified, every
file mentioned as a prerequisite, but not as a target in a rule, will have
these commands executed on its behalf.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC107">Implicit Rule Search Algorithm</A>.

The targets which <CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE> depends on are given the following
special treatment: if <CODE>make</CODE> is killed or interrupted during the
execution of their commands, the target is not deleted.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC49">Interrupting or Killing <CODE>make</CODE></A>.  Also, if the
target is an intermediate file, it will not be deleted after it is no
longer needed, as is normally done.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC97">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>.  In this latter respect it overlaps with the
<CODE>.SECONDARY</CODE> special target.

You can also list the target pattern of an implicit rule (such as
<SAMP>`%.o'</SAMP>) as a prerequisite file of the special target <CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE>
to preserve intermediate files created by rules whose target patterns
match that file's name.

See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC97">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>.

<CODE>.SECONDARY</CODE> with no prerequisites causes all targets to be treated

<DT><CODE>.DELETE_ON_ERROR</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX217"></A>

If <CODE>.DELETE_ON_ERROR</CODE> is mentioned as a target anywhere in the

does when it receives a signal.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC48">Errors in Commands</A>.

<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
<DT><CODE>.IGNORE</CODE>
<DD>
If you specify prerequisites for <CODE>.IGNORE</CODE>, then <CODE>make</CODE> will
ignore errors in execution of the commands run for those particular
files.  The commands for <CODE>.IGNORE</CODE> are not meaningful.

If mentioned as a target with no prerequisites, <CODE>.IGNORE</CODE> says to
ignore errors in execution of commands for all files.  This usage of
<SAMP>`.IGNORE'</SAMP> is supported only for historical compatibility.  Since
this affects every command in the makefile, it is not very useful; we
recommend you use the more selective ways to ignore errors in specific
commands.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC48">Errors in Commands</A>.

<A NAME="IDX219"></A>
<DT><CODE>.SILENT</CODE>
<DD>
If you specify prerequisites for <CODE>.SILENT</CODE>, then <CODE>make</CODE> will
not print the commands to remake those particular files before executing
them.  The commands for <CODE>.SILENT</CODE> are not meaningful.

If mentioned as a target with no prerequisites, <CODE>.SILENT</CODE> says not
to print any commands before executing them.  This usage of
<SAMP>`.SILENT'</SAMP> is supported only for historical compatibility.  We
recommend you use the more selective ways to silence specific commands.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC45">Command Echoing</A>.  If you want to silence all commands
for a particular run of <CODE>make</CODE>, use the <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--silent'</SAMP> option (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC92">Summary of Options</A>).

<A NAME="IDX220"></A>
<DT><CODE>.EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES</CODE>
<DD>
Simply by being mentioned as a target, this tells <CODE>make</CODE> to
export all variables to child processes by default.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC52">Communicating Variables to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>.

<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
<DT><CODE>.NOTPARALLEL</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX222"></A>

If <CODE>.NOTPARALLEL</CODE> is mentioned as a target, then this invocation of
<CODE>make</CODE> will be run serially, even if the <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option is
given.  Any recursively invoked <CODE>make</CODE> command will still be run in
parallel (unless its makefile contains this target).  Any prerequisites
on this target are ignored.
</DL>

<P>
Any defined implicit rule suffix also counts as a special target if it
appears as a target, and so does the concatenation of two suffixes, such
as <SAMP>`.c.o'</SAMP>.  These targets are suffix rules, an obsolete way of
defining implicit rules (but a way still widely used).  In principle, any
target name could be special in this way if you break it in two and add
both pieces to the suffix list.  In practice, suffixes normally begin with
<SAMP>`.'</SAMP>, so these special target names also begin with <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>.

A rule with multiple targets is equivalent to writing many rules, each with
one target, and all identical aside from that.  The same commands apply to
all the targets, but their effects may vary because you can substitute the
actual target name into the command using <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP>.  The rule contributes
the same prerequisites to all the targets also.

</P>
<P>
This is useful in two cases.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You want just prerequisites, no commands.  For example:


<PRE>
kbd.o command.o files.o: command.h
</PRE>

gives an additional prerequisite to each of the three object files
mentioned.

<LI>

Similar commands work for all the targets.  The commands do not need
to be absolutely identical, since the automatic variable <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP>
can be used to substitute the particular target to be remade into the
commands (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC101">Automatic Variables</A>).  For example:


<PRE>
bigoutput littleoutput : text.g
        generate text.g -$(subst output,,$@) &#62; $@
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX227"></A>

is equivalent to


<PRE>
bigoutput : text.g
        generate text.g -big &#62; bigoutput
littleoutput : text.g
        generate text.g -little &#62; littleoutput
</PRE>

Here we assume the hypothetical program <CODE>generate</CODE> makes two
types of output, one if given <SAMP>`-big'</SAMP> and one if given
<SAMP>`-little'</SAMP>.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC77">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</A>,
for an explanation of the <CODE>subst</CODE> function.
</UL>

<P>
Suppose you would like to vary the prerequisites according to the target,
much as the variable <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> allows you to vary the commands.
You cannot do this with multiple targets in an ordinary rule, but you can
do it with a <STRONG>static pattern rule</STRONG>.

One file can be the target of several rules.  All the prerequisites
mentioned in all the rules are merged into one list of prerequisites for
the target.  If the target is older than any prerequisite from any rule,
the commands are executed.

</P>
<P>
There can only be one set of commands to be executed for a file.
If more than one rule gives commands for the same file,
<CODE>make</CODE> uses the last set given and prints an error message.
(As a special case, if the file's name begins with a dot, no
error message is printed.  This odd behavior is only for
compatibility with other implementations of <CODE>make</CODE>.)
There is no reason to
write your makefiles this way; that is why <CODE>make</CODE> gives you
an error message.
</P>
<P>
An extra rule with just prerequisites can be used to give a few extra
prerequisites to many files at once.  For example, one usually has a
variable named <CODE>objects</CODE> containing a list of all the compiler output
files in the system being made.  An easy way to say that all of them must
be recompiled if <TT>`config.h'</TT> changes is to write the following:

</P>

<PRE>
objects = foo.o bar.o
foo.o : defs.h
bar.o : defs.h test.h
$(objects) : config.h
</PRE>

<P>
This could be inserted or taken out without changing the rules that really
specify how to make the object files, making it a convenient form to use if
you wish to add the additional prerequisite intermittently.

</P>
<P>
Another wrinkle is that the additional prerequisites could be specified with
a variable that you set with a command argument to <CODE>make</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC90">Overriding Variables</A>).  For example,

</P>

<PRE>
extradeps=
$(objects) : $(extradeps)
</PRE>

<P>
means that the command <SAMP>`make extradeps=foo.h'</SAMP> will consider
<TT>`foo.h'</TT> as a prerequisite of each object file, but plain <SAMP>`make'</SAMP>
will not.

</P>
<P>
If none of the explicit rules for a target has commands, then <CODE>make</CODE>
searches for an applicable implicit rule to find some commands
see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC93">Using Implicit Rules</A>).

<STRONG>Static pattern rules</STRONG> are rules which specify multiple targets and
construct the prerequisite names for each target based on the target name.
They are more general than ordinary rules with multiple targets because the
targets do not have to have identical prerequisites.  Their prerequisites must
be <EM>analogous</EM>, but not necessarily <EM>identical</EM>.

<A NAME="IDX238"></A>

</P>
<P>
Here is the syntax of a static pattern rule:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>targets</VAR> ...: <VAR>target-pattern</VAR>: <VAR>dep-patterns</VAR> ...
        <VAR>commands</VAR>
        ...
</PRE>

<P>
The <VAR>targets</VAR> list specifies the targets that the rule applies to.
The targets can contain wildcard characters, just like the targets of
ordinary rules (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC22">Using Wildcard Characters in File Names</A>).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX239"></A>
<A NAME="IDX240"></A>
The <VAR>target-pattern</VAR> and <VAR>dep-patterns</VAR> say how to compute the
prerequisites of each target.  Each target is matched against the
<VAR>target-pattern</VAR> to extract a part of the target name, called the
<STRONG>stem</STRONG>.  This stem is substituted into each of the <VAR>dep-patterns</VAR>
to make the prerequisite names (one from each <VAR>dep-pattern</VAR>).

</P>
<P>
Each pattern normally contains the character <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> just once.  When the
<VAR>target-pattern</VAR> matches a target, the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> can match any part of
the target name; this part is called the <STRONG>stem</STRONG>.  The rest of the
pattern must match exactly.  For example, the target <TT>`foo.o'</TT> matches
the pattern <SAMP>`%.o'</SAMP>, with <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> as the stem.  The targets
<TT>`foo.c'</TT> and <TT>`foo.out'</TT> do not match that pattern.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX241"></A>
The prerequisite names for each target are made by substituting the stem
for the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> in each prerequisite pattern.  For example, if one
prerequisite pattern is <TT>`%.c'</TT>, then substitution of the stem
<SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> gives the prerequisite name <TT>`foo.c'</TT>.  It is legitimate
to write a prerequisite pattern that does not contain <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>; then this
prerequisite is the same for all targets.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX242"></A>
<A NAME="IDX243"></A>
<A NAME="IDX244"></A>
<A NAME="IDX245"></A>
<A NAME="IDX246"></A>
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters in pattern rules can be quoted with preceding
backslashes (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>).  Backslashes that would otherwise quote <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>
characters can be quoted with more backslashes.  Backslashes that quote
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters or other backslashes are removed from the pattern
before it is compared to file names or has a stem substituted into it.
Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters go
unmolested.  For example, the pattern <TT>`the\%weird\\%pattern\\'</TT> has
<SAMP>`the%weird\'</SAMP> preceding the operative <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> character, and
<SAMP>`pattern\\'</SAMP> following it.  The final two backslashes are left alone
because they cannot affect any <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> character.
</P>
<P>
Here is an example, which compiles each of <TT>`foo.o'</TT> and <TT>`bar.o'</TT>
from the corresponding <TT>`.c'</TT> file:

</P>

<PRE>
objects = foo.o bar.o

all: $(objects)

$(objects): %.o: %.c
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $&#60; -o $@
</PRE>

<P>
Here <SAMP>`$&#60;'</SAMP> is the automatic variable that holds the name of the
prerequisite and <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> is the automatic variable that holds the name
of the target; see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC101">Automatic Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
Each target specified must match the target pattern; a warning is issued
for each target that does not.  If you have a list of files, only some of
which will match the pattern, you can use the <CODE>filter</CODE> function to
remove nonmatching file names (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC77">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</A>):

</P>

<PRE>
files = foo.elc bar.o lose.o

$(filter %.o,$(files)): %.o: %.c
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $&#60; -o $@
$(filter %.elc,$(files)): %.elc: %.el
        emacs -f batch-byte-compile $&#60;
</PRE>

<P>
In this example the result of <SAMP>`$(filter %.o,$(files))'</SAMP> is
<TT>`bar.o lose.o'</TT>, and the first static pattern rule causes each of
these object files to be updated by compiling the corresponding C source
file.  The result of <SAMP>`$(filter %.elc,$(files))'</SAMP> is
<TT>`foo.elc'</TT>, so that file is made from <TT>`foo.el'</TT>.
</P>
<P>
Another example shows how to use <CODE>$*</CODE> in static pattern rules:
<A NAME="IDX247"></A>

</P>

<PRE>
bigoutput littleoutput : %output : text.g
        generate text.g -$* &#62; $@
</PRE>

<P>
When the <CODE>generate</CODE> command is run, <CODE>$*</CODE> will expand to the
stem, either <SAMP>`big'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`little'</SAMP>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC41" HREF="make.html#TOC41">Static Pattern Rules versus Implicit Rules</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX248"></A>
<A NAME="IDX249"></A>

</P>
<P>
A static pattern rule has much in common with an implicit rule defined as a
pattern rule (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC98">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</A>).
Both have a pattern for the target and patterns for constructing the
names of prerequisites.  The difference is in how <CODE>make</CODE> decides
<EM>when</EM> the rule applies.

</P>
<P>
An implicit rule <EM>can</EM> apply to any target that matches its pattern,
but it <EM>does</EM> apply only when the target has no commands otherwise
specified, and only when the prerequisites can be found.  If more than one
implicit rule appears applicable, only one applies; the choice depends on
the order of rules.

</P>
<P>
By contrast, a static pattern rule applies to the precise list of targets
that you specify in the rule.  It cannot apply to any other target and it
invariably does apply to each of the targets specified.  If two conflicting
rules apply, and both have commands, that's an error.

</P>
<P>
The static pattern rule can be better than an implicit rule for these
reasons:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You may wish to override the usual implicit rule for a few
files whose names cannot be categorized syntactically but
can be given in an explicit list.

<LI>

If you cannot be sure of the precise contents of the directories
you are using, you may not be sure which other irrelevant files
might lead <CODE>make</CODE> to use the wrong implicit rule.  The choice
might depend on the order in which the implicit rule search is done.
With static pattern rules, there is no uncertainty: each rule applies
to precisely the targets specified.

<P>
<STRONG>Double-colon</STRONG> rules are rules written with <SAMP>`::'</SAMP> instead of
<SAMP>`:'</SAMP> after the target names.  They are handled differently from
ordinary rules when the same target appears in more than one rule.

</P>
<P>
When a target appears in multiple rules, all the rules must be the same
type: all ordinary, or all double-colon.  If they are double-colon, each of
them is independent of the others.  Each double-colon rule's commands are
executed if the target is older than any prerequisites of that rule.  This
can result in executing none, any, or all of the double-colon rules.

</P>
<P>
Double-colon rules with the same target are in fact completely separate
from one another.  Each double-colon rule is processed individually, just
as rules with different targets are processed.

</P>
<P>
The double-colon rules for a target are executed in the order they appear
in the makefile.  However, the cases where double-colon rules really make
sense are those where the order of executing the commands would not matter.

</P>
<P>
Double-colon rules are somewhat obscure and not often very useful; they
provide a mechanism for cases in which the method used to update a target
differs depending on which prerequisite files caused the update, and such
cases are rare.

</P>
<P>
Each double-colon rule should specify commands; if it does not, an
implicit rule will be used if one applies.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC93">Using Implicit Rules</A>.

<A NAME="IDX256"></A>

</P>
<P>
In the makefile for a program, many of the rules you need to write often
say only that some object file depends on some header
file.  For example, if <TT>`main.c'</TT> uses <TT>`defs.h'</TT> via an
<CODE>#include</CODE>, you would write:

</P>

<PRE>
main.o: defs.h
</PRE>

<P>
You need this rule so that <CODE>make</CODE> knows that it must remake
<TT>`main.o'</TT> whenever <TT>`defs.h'</TT> changes.  You can see that for a
large program you would have to write dozens of such rules in your
makefile.  And, you must always be very careful to update the makefile
every time you add or remove an <CODE>#include</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX257"></A>

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX258"></A>
To avoid this hassle, most modern C compilers can write these rules for
you, by looking at the <CODE>#include</CODE> lines in the source files.
Usually this is done with the <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP> option to the compiler.
For example, the command:

</P>

<PRE>
cc -M main.c
</PRE>

<P>
generates the output:

</P>

<PRE>
main.o : main.c defs.h
</PRE>

<P>
Thus you no longer have to write all those rules yourself.
The compiler will do it for you.

</P>
<P>
Note that such a prerequisite constitutes mentioning <TT>`main.o'</TT> in a
makefile, so it can never be considered an intermediate file by implicit
rule search.  This means that <CODE>make</CODE> won't ever remove the file
after using it; see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC97">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX259"></A>
With old <CODE>make</CODE> programs, it was traditional practice to use this
compiler feature to generate prerequisites on demand with a command like
<SAMP>`make depend'</SAMP>.  That command would create a file <TT>`depend'</TT>
containing all the automatically-generated prerequisites; then the
makefile could use <CODE>include</CODE> to read them in (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC15">Including Other Makefiles</A>).

</P>
<P>
In GNU <CODE>make</CODE>, the feature of remaking makefiles makes this
practice obsolete--you need never tell <CODE>make</CODE> explicitly to
regenerate the prerequisites, because it always regenerates any makefile
that is out of date.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC17">How Makefiles Are Remade</A>.

</P>
<P>
The practice we recommend for automatic prerequisite generation is to have
one makefile corresponding to each source file.  For each source file
<TT>`<VAR>name</VAR>.c'</TT> there is a makefile <TT>`<VAR>name</VAR>.d'</TT> which lists
what files the object file <TT>`<VAR>name</VAR>.o'</TT> depends on.  That way
only the source files that have changed need to be rescanned to produce
the new prerequisites.

</P>
<P>
Here is the pattern rule to generate a file of prerequisites (i.e., a makefile)
called <TT>`<VAR>name</VAR>.d'</TT> from a C source file called <TT>`<VAR>name</VAR>.c'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
%.d: %.c
        set -e; $(CC) -M $(CPPFLAGS) $&#60; \
                  | sed 's/\($*\)\.o[ :]*/\1.o $@ : /g' &#62; $@; \
                [ -s $@ ] || rm -f $@
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC98">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</A>, for information on defining pattern rules.  The
<SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> flag to the shell makes it exit immediately if the
<CODE>$(CC)</CODE> command fails (exits with a nonzero status).  Normally the
shell exits with the status of the last command in the pipeline
(<CODE>sed</CODE> in this case), so <CODE>make</CODE> would not notice a nonzero
status from the compiler.

With the GNU C compiler, you may wish to use the <SAMP>`-MM'</SAMP> flag instead
of <SAMP>`-M'</SAMP>.  This omits prerequisites on system header files.
See section `Options Controlling the Preprocessor' in <CITE>Using GNU CC</CITE>, for details.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX262"></A>
The purpose of the <CODE>sed</CODE> command is to translate (for example):

</P>

<PRE>
main.o : main.c defs.h
</PRE>

<P>
into:

</P>

<PRE>
main.o main.d : main.c defs.h
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX263"></A>
This makes each <SAMP>`.d'</SAMP> file depend on all the source and header files
that the corresponding <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> file depends on.  <CODE>make</CODE> then
knows it must regenerate the prerequisites whenever any of the source or
header files changes.

</P>
<P>
Once you've defined the rule to remake the <SAMP>`.d'</SAMP> files,
you then use the <CODE>include</CODE> directive to read them all in.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC15">Including Other Makefiles</A>.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
sources = foo.c bar.c

include $(sources:.c=.d)
</PRE>

<P>
(This example uses a substitution variable reference to translate the
list of source files <SAMP>`foo.c bar.c'</SAMP> into a list of prerequisite
makefiles, <SAMP>`foo.d bar.d'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC61">Substitution References</A>, for full
information on substitution references.)  Since the <SAMP>`.d'</SAMP> files are
makefiles like any others, <CODE>make</CODE> will remake them as necessary
with no further work from you.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC17">How Makefiles Are Remade</A>.

The commands of a rule consist of shell command lines to be executed one
by one.  Each command line must start with a tab, except that the first
command line may be attached to the target-and-prerequisites line with a
semicolon in between.  Blank lines and lines of just comments may appear
among the command lines; they are ignored.  (But beware, an apparently
"blank" line that begins with a tab is <EM>not</EM> blank!  It is an
empty command; see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC56">Using Empty Commands</A>.)

</P>
<P>
Users use many different shell programs, but commands in makefiles are
always interpreted by <TT>`/bin/sh'</TT> unless the makefile specifies
otherwise.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC46">Command Execution</A>.

<A NAME="IDX267"></A>

The shell that is in use determines whether comments can be written on
command lines, and what syntax they use.  When the shell is
<TT>`/bin/sh'</TT>, a <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> starts a comment that extends to the end of
the line.  The <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> does not have to be at the beginning of a line.
Text on a line before a <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> is not part of the comment.

Normally <CODE>make</CODE> prints each command line before it is executed.
We call this <STRONG>echoing</STRONG> because it gives the appearance that you
are typing the commands yourself.

</P>
<P>
When a line starts with <SAMP>`@'</SAMP>, the echoing of that line is suppressed.
The <SAMP>`@'</SAMP> is discarded before the command is passed to the shell.
Typically you would use this for a command whose only effect is to print
something, such as an <CODE>echo</CODE> command to indicate progress through
the makefile:

</P>

<PRE>
@echo About to make distribution files

<A NAME="IDX275"></A>
<A NAME="IDX276"></A>
<A NAME="IDX277"></A>
<A NAME="IDX278"></A>
When <CODE>make</CODE> is given the flag <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--just-print'</SAMP>
it only echoes commands, it won't execute them.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC92">Summary of Options</A>.  In this case and only this case, even the
commands starting with <SAMP>`@'</SAMP> are printed.  This flag is useful for
finding out which commands <CODE>make</CODE> thinks are necessary without
actually doing them.

<A NAME="IDX279"></A>

The <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--silent'</SAMP>
flag to <CODE>make</CODE> prevents all echoing, as if all commands
started with <SAMP>`@'</SAMP>.  A rule in the makefile for the special target
<CODE>.SILENT</CODE> without prerequisites has the same effect
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC36">Special Built-in Target Names</A>).
<CODE>.SILENT</CODE> is essentially obsolete since <SAMP>`@'</SAMP> is more flexible.

When it is time to execute commands to update a target, they are executed
by making a new subshell for each line.  (In practice, <CODE>make</CODE> may
take shortcuts that do not affect the results.)

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX287"></A>
<STRONG>Please note:</STRONG> this implies that shell commands such as <CODE>cd</CODE>
that set variables local to each process will not affect the following
command lines. <A NAME="DOCF2" HREF="make.html#FOOT2">(2)</A>  If you want to use <CODE>cd</CODE>
to affect the next command, put the two on a single line with a
semicolon between them.  Then <CODE>make</CODE> will consider them a single
command and pass them, together, to a shell which will execute them in
sequence.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
foo : bar/lose
        cd bar; gobble lose &#62; ../foo
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX288"></A>

<A NAME="IDX291"></A>
<A NAME="IDX292"></A>
<A NAME="IDX293"></A>
If you would like to split a single shell command into multiple lines of
text, you must use a backslash at the end of all but the last subline.
Such a sequence of lines is combined into a single line, by deleting the
backslash-newline sequences, before passing it to the shell.  Thus, the
following is equivalent to the preceding example:

</P>

<PRE>
foo : bar/lose
        cd bar;  \
        gobble lose &#62; ../foo
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX294"></A>
The program used as the shell is taken from the variable <CODE>SHELL</CODE>.
By default, the program <TT>`/bin/sh'</TT> is used.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX295"></A>
On MS-DOS, if <CODE>SHELL</CODE> is not set, the value of the variable
<CODE>COMSPEC</CODE> (which is always set) is used instead.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX296"></A>
The processing of lines that set the variable <CODE>SHELL</CODE> in Makefiles
is different on MS-DOS.  The stock shell, <TT>`command.com'</TT>, is
ridiculously limited in its functionality and many users of <CODE>make</CODE>
tend to install a replacement shell.  Therefore, on MS-DOS, <CODE>make</CODE>
examines the value of <CODE>SHELL</CODE>, and changes its behavior based on
whether it points to a Unix-style or DOS-style shell.  This allows
reasonable functionality even if <CODE>SHELL</CODE> points to
<TT>`command.com'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>SHELL</CODE> points to a Unix-style shell, <CODE>make</CODE> on MS-DOS
additionally checks whether that shell can indeed be found; if not, it
ignores the line that sets <CODE>SHELL</CODE>.  In MS-DOS, GNU <CODE>make</CODE>
searches for the shell in the following places:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

In the precise place pointed to by the value of <CODE>SHELL</CODE>.  For
example, if the makefile specifies <SAMP>`SHELL = /bin/sh'</SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE>
will look in the directory <TT>`/bin'</TT> on the current drive.

<LI>

In the current directory.

<LI>

In each of the directories in the <CODE>PATH</CODE> variable, in order.

</OL>

<P>
In every directory it examines, <CODE>make</CODE> will first look for the
specific file (<TT>`sh'</TT> in the example above).  If this is not found,
it will also look in that directory for that file with one of the known
extensions which identify executable files.  For example <TT>`.exe'</TT>,
<TT>`.com'</TT>, <TT>`.bat'</TT>, <TT>`.btm'</TT>, <TT>`.sh'</TT>, and some others.

</P>
<P>
If any of these attempts is successful, the value of <CODE>SHELL</CODE> will
be set to the full pathname of the shell as found.  However, if none of
these is found, the value of <CODE>SHELL</CODE> will not be changed, and thus
the line that sets it will be effectively ignored.  This is so
<CODE>make</CODE> will only support features specific to a Unix-style shell if
such a shell is actually installed on the system where <CODE>make</CODE> runs.

</P>
<P>
Note that this extended search for the shell is limited to the cases
where <CODE>SHELL</CODE> is set from the Makefile; if it is set in the
environment or command line, you are expected to set it to the full
pathname of the shell, exactly as things are on Unix.

</P>
<P>
The effect of the above DOS-specific processing is that a Makefile that
says <SAMP>`SHELL = /bin/sh'</SAMP> (as many Unix makefiles do), will work
on MS-DOS unaltered if you have e.g. <TT>`sh.exe'</TT> installed in some
directory along your <CODE>PATH</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX297"></A>
Unlike most variables, the variable <CODE>SHELL</CODE> is never set from the
environment.  This is because the <CODE>SHELL</CODE> environment variable is
used to specify your personal choice of shell program for interactive
use.  It would be very bad for personal choices like this to affect the
functioning of makefiles.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC68">Variables from the Environment</A>.  However, on MS-DOS and MS-Windows the value of
<CODE>SHELL</CODE> in the environment <STRONG>is</STRONG> used, since on those systems
most users do not set this variable, and therefore it is most likely set
specifically to be used by <CODE>make</CODE>.  On MS-DOS, if the setting of
<CODE>SHELL</CODE> is not suitable for <CODE>make</CODE>, you can set the variable
<CODE>MAKESHELL</CODE> to the shell that <CODE>make</CODE> should use; this will
override the value of <CODE>SHELL</CODE>.

GNU <CODE>make</CODE> knows how to execute several commands at once.
Normally, <CODE>make</CODE> will execute only one command at a time, waiting
for it to finish before executing the next.  However, the <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--jobs'</SAMP> option tells <CODE>make</CODE> to execute many commands
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
On MS-DOS, the <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option has no effect, since that system doesn't
support multi-processing.

</P>
<P>
If the <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option is followed by an integer, this is the number of
commands to execute at once; this is called the number of <STRONG>job slots</STRONG>.
If there is nothing looking like an integer after the <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option,
there is no limit on the number of job slots.  The default number of job
slots is one, which means serial execution (one thing at a time).

</P>
<P>
One unpleasant consequence of running several commands simultaneously is
that output generated by the commands appears whenever each command
sends it, so messages from different commands may be interspersed.

</P>
<P>
Another problem is that two processes cannot both take input from the
same device; so to make sure that only one command tries to take input
from the terminal at once, <CODE>make</CODE> will invalidate the standard
input streams of all but one running command.  This means that
attempting to read from standard input will usually be a fatal error (a
<SAMP>`Broken pipe'</SAMP> signal) for most child processes if there are
several.
<A NAME="IDX304"></A>
<A NAME="IDX305"></A>

</P>
<P>
It is unpredictable which command will have a valid standard input stream
(which will come from the terminal, or wherever you redirect the standard
input of <CODE>make</CODE>).  The first command run will always get it first, and
the first command started after that one finishes will get it next, and so
on.

</P>
<P>
We will change how this aspect of <CODE>make</CODE> works if we find a better
alternative.  In the mean time, you should not rely on any command using
standard input at all if you are using the parallel execution feature; but
if you are not using this feature, then standard input works normally in
all commands.

</P>
<P>
Finally, handling recursive <CODE>make</CODE> invocations raises issues.  For
more information on this, see
section <A HREF="make.html#SEC53">Communicating Options to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
If a command fails (is killed by a signal or exits with a nonzero
status), and errors are not ignored for that command
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC48">Errors in Commands</A>),
the remaining command lines to remake the same target will not be run.
If a command fails and the <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--keep-going'</SAMP>
option was not given
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC92">Summary of Options</A>),
<CODE>make</CODE> aborts execution.  If make
terminates for any reason (including a signal) with child processes
running, it waits for them to finish before actually exiting.

When the system is heavily loaded, you will probably want to run fewer jobs
than when it is lightly loaded.  You can use the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option to tell
<CODE>make</CODE> to limit the number of jobs to run at once, based on the load
average.  The <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--max-load'</SAMP>
option is followed by a floating-point number.  For
example,

</P>

<PRE>
-l 2.5
</PRE>

<P>
will not let <CODE>make</CODE> start more than one job if the load average is
above 2.5.  The <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option with no following number removes the
load limit, if one was given with a previous <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option.
</P>
<P>
More precisely, when <CODE>make</CODE> goes to start up a job, and it already has
at least one job running, it checks the current load average; if it is not
lower than the limit given with <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE> waits until the load
average goes below that limit, or until all the other jobs finish.

</P>
<P>
By default, there is no load limit.

After each shell command returns, <CODE>make</CODE> looks at its exit status.
If the command completed successfully, the next command line is executed
in a new shell; after the last command line is finished, the rule is
finished.

</P>
<P>
If there is an error (the exit status is nonzero), <CODE>make</CODE> gives up on
the current rule, and perhaps on all rules.

</P>
<P>
Sometimes the failure of a certain command does not indicate a problem.
For example, you may use the <CODE>mkdir</CODE> command to ensure that a
directory exists.  If the directory already exists, <CODE>mkdir</CODE> will
report an error, but you probably want <CODE>make</CODE> to continue regardless.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX315"></A>
To ignore errors in a command line, write a <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> at the beginning of
the line's text (after the initial tab).  The <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> is discarded before
the command is passed to the shell for execution.

</P>
<P>
For example,

</P>

<PRE>
clean:
        -rm -f *.o
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX316"></A>

<A NAME="IDX319"></A>
When you run <CODE>make</CODE> with the <SAMP>`-i'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--ignore-errors'</SAMP>
flag, errors are ignored in all commands of all rules.  A rule in the
makefile for the special target <CODE>.IGNORE</CODE> has the same effect, if
there are no prerequisites.  These ways of ignoring errors are obsolete
because <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> is more flexible.

</P>
<P>
When errors are to be ignored, because of either a <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> or the
<SAMP>`-i'</SAMP> flag, <CODE>make</CODE> treats an error return just like success,
except that it prints out a message that tells you the status code
the command exited with, and says that the error has been ignored.

</P>
<P>
When an error happens that <CODE>make</CODE> has not been told to ignore,
it implies that the current target cannot be correctly remade, and neither
can any other that depends on it either directly or indirectly.  No further
commands will be executed for these targets, since their preconditions
have not been achieved.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX320"></A>
<A NAME="IDX321"></A>
Normally <CODE>make</CODE> gives up immediately in this circumstance, returning a
nonzero status.  However, if the <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--keep-going'</SAMP>
flag is specified, <CODE>make</CODE>
continues to consider the other prerequisites of the pending targets,
remaking them if necessary, before it gives up and returns nonzero status.
For example, after an error in compiling one object file, <SAMP>`make -k'</SAMP>
will continue compiling other object files even though it already knows
that linking them will be impossible.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC92">Summary of Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
The usual behavior assumes that your purpose is to get the specified
targets up to date; once <CODE>make</CODE> learns that this is impossible, it
might as well report the failure immediately.  The <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> option says
that the real purpose is to test as many of the changes made in the
program as possible, perhaps to find several independent problems so
that you can correct them all before the next attempt to compile.  This
is why Emacs' <CODE>compile</CODE> command passes the <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> flag by
default.

Usually when a command fails, if it has changed the target file at all,
the file is corrupted and cannot be used--or at least it is not
completely updated.  Yet the file's timestamp says that it is now up to
date, so the next time <CODE>make</CODE> runs, it will not try to update that
file.  The situation is just the same as when the command is killed by a
signal; see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC49">Interrupting or Killing <CODE>make</CODE></A>.  So generally the right thing to do is to
delete the target file if the command fails after beginning to change
the file.  <CODE>make</CODE> will do this if <CODE>.DELETE_ON_ERROR</CODE> appears
as a target.  This is almost always what you want <CODE>make</CODE> to do, but
it is not historical practice; so for compatibility, you must explicitly
request it.

If <CODE>make</CODE> gets a fatal signal while a command is executing, it may
delete the target file that the command was supposed to update.  This is
done if the target file's last-modification time has changed since
<CODE>make</CODE> first checked it.

</P>
<P>
The purpose of deleting the target is to make sure that it is remade from
scratch when <CODE>make</CODE> is next run.  Why is this?  Suppose you type
<KBD>Ctrl-c</KBD> while a compiler is running, and it has begun to write an
object file <TT>`foo.o'</TT>.  The <KBD>Ctrl-c</KBD> kills the compiler, resulting
in an incomplete file whose last-modification time is newer than the source
file <TT>`foo.c'</TT>.  But <CODE>make</CODE> also receives the <KBD>Ctrl-c</KBD> signal
and deletes this incomplete file.  If <CODE>make</CODE> did not do this, the next
invocation of <CODE>make</CODE> would think that <TT>`foo.o'</TT> did not require
updating--resulting in a strange error message from the linker when it
tries to link an object file half of which is missing.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX333"></A>
You can prevent the deletion of a target file in this way by making the
special target <CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE> depend on it.  Before remaking a target,
<CODE>make</CODE> checks to see whether it appears on the prerequisites of
<CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE>, and thereby decides whether the target should be deleted
if a signal happens.  Some reasons why you might do this are that the
target is updated in some atomic fashion, or exists only to record a
modification-time (its contents do not matter), or must exist at all
times to prevent other sorts of trouble.

Recursive use of <CODE>make</CODE> means using <CODE>make</CODE> as a command in a

various subsystems that compose a larger system.  For example, suppose you
have a subdirectory <TT>`subdir'</TT> which has its own makefile, and you would
like the containing directory's makefile to run <CODE>make</CODE> on the

not the explicit command name <SAMP>`make'</SAMP>, as shown here:

</P>

<PRE>
subsystem:
        cd subdir &#38;&#38; $(MAKE)
</PRE>

<P>
The value of this variable is the file name with which <CODE>make</CODE> was
invoked.  If this file name was <TT>`/bin/make'</TT>, then the command executed
is <SAMP>`cd subdir &#38;&#38; /bin/make'</SAMP>.  If you use a special version of
<CODE>make</CODE> to run the top-level makefile, the same special version will be
executed for recursive invocations.
<A NAME="IDX340"></A>

</P>
<P>
As a special feature, using the variable <CODE>MAKE</CODE> in the commands of
a rule alters the effects of the <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> (<SAMP>`--touch'</SAMP>), <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP>
(<SAMP>`--just-print'</SAMP>), or <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP> (<SAMP>`--question'</SAMP>) option.
Using the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> variable has the same effect as using a <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>
character at the beginning of the command line.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC88">Instead of Executing the Commands</A>.
</P>
<P>
Consider the command <SAMP>`make -t'</SAMP> in the above example.  (The
<SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> option marks targets as up to date without actually running
any commands; see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC88">Instead of Executing the Commands</A>.)  Following the usual
definition of <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP>, a <SAMP>`make -t'</SAMP> command in the example would
create a file named <TT>`subsystem'</TT> and do nothing else.  What you
really want it to do is run <SAMP>`cd subdir &#38;&#38; make -t'</SAMP>; but that would
require executing the command, and <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> says not to execute
commands.<A NAME="IDX341"></A>
<A NAME="IDX342"></A>
<A NAME="IDX343"></A>

</P>
<P>
The special feature makes this do what you want: whenever a command
line of a rule contains the variable <CODE>MAKE</CODE>, the flags <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-n'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP> do not apply to that line.  Command lines
containing <CODE>MAKE</CODE> are executed normally despite the presence of a
flag that causes most commands not to be run.  The usual
<CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> mechanism passes the flags to the sub-<CODE>make</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC53">Communicating Options to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>), so your request to touch the files, or print the
commands, is propagated to the subsystem.

Variable values of the top-level <CODE>make</CODE> can be passed to the
sub-<CODE>make</CODE> through the environment by explicit request.  These
variables are defined in the sub-<CODE>make</CODE> as defaults, but do not
override what is specified in the makefile used by the sub-<CODE>make</CODE>
makefile unless you use the <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> switch (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC92">Summary of Options</A>).
</P>
<P>
To pass down, or <STRONG>export</STRONG>, a variable, <CODE>make</CODE> adds the variable
and its value to the environment for running each command.  The
sub-<CODE>make</CODE>, in turn, uses the environment to initialize its table
of variable values.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC68">Variables from the Environment</A>.

</P>
<P>
Except by explicit request, <CODE>make</CODE> exports a variable only if it
is either defined in the environment initially or set on the command
line, and if its name consists only of letters, numbers, and underscores.
Some shells cannot cope with environment variable names consisting of
characters other than letters, numbers, and underscores.

</P>
<P>
The special variables <CODE>SHELL</CODE> and <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> are always
exported (unless you unexport them).
<CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> is exported if you set it to anything.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>make</CODE> automatically passes down variable values that were defined
on the command line, by putting them in the <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> variable.
See the next section.

</P>
<P>
Variables are <EM>not</EM> normally passed down if they were created by
default by <CODE>make</CODE> (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC96">Variables Used by Implicit Rules</A>).  The sub-<CODE>make</CODE> will define these for
itself.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX351"></A>
If you want to export specific variables to a sub-<CODE>make</CODE>, use the
<CODE>export</CODE> directive, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
export <VAR>variable</VAR> ...
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX352"></A>
If you want to <EM>prevent</EM> a variable from being exported, use the
<CODE>unexport</CODE> directive, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
unexport <VAR>variable</VAR> ...
</PRE>

<P>
As a convenience, you can define a variable and export it at the same
time by doing:

</P>

<PRE>
export <VAR>variable</VAR> = value
</PRE>

<P>
has the same result as:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>variable</VAR> = value
export <VAR>variable</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
and

</P>

<PRE>
export <VAR>variable</VAR> := value
</PRE>

<P>
has the same result as:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>variable</VAR> := value
export <VAR>variable</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
Likewise,

</P>

<PRE>
export <VAR>variable</VAR> += value
</PRE>

<P>
is just like:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>variable</VAR> += value
export <VAR>variable</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC65">Appending More Text to Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
You may notice that the <CODE>export</CODE> and <CODE>unexport</CODE> directives
work in <CODE>make</CODE> in the same way they work in the shell, <CODE>sh</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If you want all variables to be exported by default, you can use
<CODE>export</CODE> by itself:

</P>

<PRE>
export
</PRE>

<P>
This tells <CODE>make</CODE> that variables which are not explicitly mentioned
in an <CODE>export</CODE> or <CODE>unexport</CODE> directive should be exported.
Any variable given in an <CODE>unexport</CODE> directive will still <EM>not</EM>
be exported.  If you use <CODE>export</CODE> by itself to export variables by
default, variables whose names contain characters other than
alphanumerics and underscores will not be exported unless specifically
mentioned in an <CODE>export</CODE> directive.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX353"></A>
The behavior elicited by an <CODE>export</CODE> directive by itself was the
default in older versions of GNU <CODE>make</CODE>.  If your makefiles depend
on this behavior and you want to be compatible with old versions of
<CODE>make</CODE>, you can write a rule for the special target
<CODE>.EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES</CODE> instead of using the <CODE>export</CODE> directive.
This will be ignored by old <CODE>make</CODE>s, while the <CODE>export</CODE>
directive will cause a syntax error.<A NAME="IDX354"></A>

</P>
<P>
Likewise, you can use <CODE>unexport</CODE> by itself to tell <CODE>make</CODE>
<EM>not</EM> to export variables by default.  Since this is the default
behavior, you would only need to do this if <CODE>export</CODE> had been used
by itself earlier (in an included makefile, perhaps).  You
<STRONG>cannot</STRONG> use <CODE>export</CODE> and <CODE>unexport</CODE> by themselves to
have variables exported for some commands and not for others.  The last
<CODE>export</CODE> or <CODE>unexport</CODE> directive that appears by itself
determines the behavior for the entire run of <CODE>make</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX355"></A>
<A NAME="IDX356"></A>
As a special feature, the variable <CODE>MAKELEVEL</CODE> is changed when it
is passed down from level to level.  This variable's value is a string
which is the depth of the level as a decimal number.  The value is
<SAMP>`0'</SAMP> for the top-level <CODE>make</CODE>; <SAMP>`1'</SAMP> for a sub-<CODE>make</CODE>,
<SAMP>`2'</SAMP> for a sub-sub-<CODE>make</CODE>, and so on.  The incrementation
happens when <CODE>make</CODE> sets up the environment for a command.
</P>
<P>
The main use of <CODE>MAKELEVEL</CODE> is to test it in a conditional
directive (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC71">Conditional Parts of Makefiles</A>); this
way you can write a makefile that behaves one way if run recursively and
another way if run directly by you.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX357"></A>
You can use the variable <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> to cause all sub-<CODE>make</CODE>
commands to use additional makefiles.  The value of <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> is
a whitespace-separated list of file names.  This variable, if defined in
the outer-level makefile, is passed down through the environment; then
it serves as a list of extra makefiles for the sub-<CODE>make</CODE> to read
before the usual or specified ones.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC16">The Variable <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE></A>.

Flags such as <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> are passed automatically to the
sub-<CODE>make</CODE> through the variable <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE>.  This variable is
set up automatically by <CODE>make</CODE> to contain the flag letters that
<CODE>make</CODE> received.  Thus, if you do <SAMP>`make -ks'</SAMP> then
<CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> gets the value <SAMP>`ks'</SAMP>.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, every sub-<CODE>make</CODE> gets a value for <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE>
in its environment.  In response, it takes the flags from that value and
processes them as if they had been given as arguments.

sub-<CODE>make</CODE> through <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE>.  Words in the value of
<CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> that contain <SAMP>`='</SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE> treats as variable
definitions just as if they appeared on the command line.

The options <SAMP>`-C'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`-W'</SAMP> are not put

The <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option is a special case (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC47">Parallel Execution</A>).
If you set it to some numeric value <SAMP>`N'</SAMP> and your operating system
supports it (most any UNIX system will; others typically won't), the
parent <CODE>make</CODE> and all the sub-<CODE>make</CODE>s will communicate to
ensure that there are only <SAMP>`N'</SAMP> jobs running at the same time
between them all.  Note that any job that is marked recursive
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC88">Instead of Executing the Commands</A>)
doesn't count against the total jobs (otherwise we could get <SAMP>`N'</SAMP>
sub-<CODE>make</CODE>s running and have no slots left over for any real work!)

</P>
<P>
If your operating system doesn't support the above communication, then
<SAMP>`-j 1'</SAMP> is always put into <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> instead of the value you
specified.  This is because if the <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option were passed down
to sub-<CODE>make</CODE>s, you would get many more jobs running in parallel
than you asked for.  If you give <SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> with no numeric argument,
meaning to run as many jobs as possible in parallel, this is passed
down, since multiple infinities are no more than one.
</P>
<P>
If you do not want to pass the other flags down, you must change the
value of <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE>, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
subsystem:
        cd subdir &#38;&#38; $(MAKE) MAKEFLAGS=
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX382"></A>
The command line variable definitions really appear in the variable
<CODE>MAKEOVERRIDES</CODE>, and <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> contains a reference to this
variable.  If you do want to pass flags down normally, but don't want to
pass down the command line variable definitions, you can reset
<CODE>MAKEOVERRIDES</CODE> to empty, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
MAKEOVERRIDES =
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX383"></A>
<A NAME="IDX384"></A>
This is not usually useful to do.  However, some systems have a small
fixed limit on the size of the environment, and putting so much
information into the value of <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> can exceed it.  If you
see the error message <SAMP>`Arg list too long'</SAMP>, this may be the problem.
<A NAME="IDX385"></A>
<A NAME="IDX386"></A>
(For strict compliance with POSIX.2, changing <CODE>MAKEOVERRIDES</CODE> does
not affect <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> if the special target <SAMP>`.POSIX'</SAMP> appears
in the makefile.  You probably do not care about this.)

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX387"></A>
A similar variable <CODE>MFLAGS</CODE> exists also, for historical
compatibility.  It has the same value as <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> except that it
does not contain the command line variable definitions, and it always
begins with a hyphen unless it is empty (<CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> begins with a
hyphen only when it begins with an option that has no single-letter
version, such as <SAMP>`--warn-undefined-variables'</SAMP>).  <CODE>MFLAGS</CODE> was
traditionally used explicitly in the recursive <CODE>make</CODE> command, like
this:

</P>

<PRE>
subsystem:
        cd subdir &#38;&#38; $(MAKE) $(MFLAGS)
</PRE>

<P>
but now <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> makes this usage redundant.  If you want your
makefiles to be compatible with old <CODE>make</CODE> programs, use this
technique; it will work fine with more modern <CODE>make</CODE> versions too.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX388"></A>
<A NAME="IDX389"></A>
<A NAME="IDX390"></A>
<A NAME="IDX391"></A>
The <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> variable can also be useful if you want to have
certain options, such as <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC92">Summary of Options</A>), set each time you run <CODE>make</CODE>.  You simply put a value for
<CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> in your environment.  You can also set <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> in
a makefile, to specify additional flags that should also be in effect for
that makefile.  (Note that you cannot use <CODE>MFLAGS</CODE> this way.  That
variable is set only for compatibility; <CODE>make</CODE> does not interpret a
value you set for it in any way.)

</P>
<P>
When <CODE>make</CODE> interprets the value of <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> (either from the
environment or from a makefile), it first prepends a hyphen if the value
does not already begin with one.  Then it chops the value into words
separated by blanks, and parses these words as if they were options given
on the command line (except that <SAMP>`-C'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-h'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-o'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-W'</SAMP>, and their long-named versions are ignored; and there
is no error for an invalid option).

</P>
<P>
If you do put <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> in your environment, you should be sure not
to include any options that will drastically affect the actions of
<CODE>make</CODE> and undermine the purpose of makefiles and of <CODE>make</CODE>
itself.  For instance, the <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP> options, if
put in one of these variables, could have disastrous consequences and would
certainly have at least surprising and probably annoying effects.

If you use several levels of recursive <CODE>make</CODE> invocations, the

lot easier to understand by showing each directory as <CODE>make</CODE>
starts processing it and as <CODE>make</CODE> finishes processing it.  For
example, if <SAMP>`make -w'</SAMP> is run in the directory <TT>`/u/gnu/make'</TT>,
<CODE>make</CODE> will print a line of the form:
</P>

<PRE>
make: Entering directory `/u/gnu/make'.

<P>
before doing anything else, and a line of the form:

does it for you: <SAMP>`-w'</SAMP> is turned on automatically when you use the
<SAMP>`-C'</SAMP> option, and in sub-<CODE>make</CODE>s.  <CODE>make</CODE> will not
automatically turn on <SAMP>`-w'</SAMP> if you also use <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP>, which says to
be silent, or if you use <SAMP>`--no-print-directory'</SAMP> to explicitly

<H2><A NAME="SEC55" HREF="make.html#TOC55">Defining Canned Command Sequences</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX405"></A>
<A NAME="IDX406"></A>

</P>
<P>
When the same sequence of commands is useful in making various targets, you
can define it as a canned sequence with the <CODE>define</CODE> directive, and
refer to the canned sequence from the rules for those targets.  The canned
sequence is actually a variable, so the name must not conflict with other
variable names.

</P>
<P>
Here is an example of defining a canned sequence of commands:

</P>

<PRE>
define run-yacc
yacc $(firstword $^)
mv y.tab.c $@
endef
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX407"></A>

</P>
<P>
Here <CODE>run-yacc</CODE> is the name of the variable being defined;
<CODE>endef</CODE> marks the end of the definition; the lines in between are the
commands.  The <CODE>define</CODE> directive does not expand variable references
and function calls in the canned sequence; the <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> characters,
parentheses, variable names, and so on, all become part of the value of the
variable you are defining.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC67">Defining Variables Verbatim</A>,
for a complete explanation of <CODE>define</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The first command in this example runs Yacc on the first prerequisite of
whichever rule uses the canned sequence.  The output file from Yacc is
always named <TT>`y.tab.c'</TT>.  The second command moves the output to the
rule's target file name.

</P>
<P>
To use the canned sequence, substitute the variable into the commands of a
rule.  You can substitute it like any other variable
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC58">Basics of Variable References</A>).
Because variables defined by <CODE>define</CODE> are recursively expanded
variables, all the variable references you wrote inside the <CODE>define</CODE>
are expanded now.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
foo.c : foo.y
        $(run-yacc)
</PRE>

<P>
<SAMP>`foo.y'</SAMP> will be substituted for the variable <SAMP>`$^'</SAMP> when it occurs in
<CODE>run-yacc</CODE>'s value, and <SAMP>`foo.c'</SAMP> for <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP>.
</P>
<P>
This is a realistic example, but this particular one is not needed in
practice because <CODE>make</CODE> has an implicit rule to figure out these
commands based on the file names involved
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC93">Using Implicit Rules</A>).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX408"></A>
<A NAME="IDX409"></A>
<A NAME="IDX410"></A>
In command execution, each line of a canned sequence is treated just as
if the line appeared on its own in the rule, preceded by a tab.  In
particular, <CODE>make</CODE> invokes a separate subshell for each line.  You
can use the special prefix characters that affect command lines
(<SAMP>`@'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>) on each line of a canned sequence.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC44">Writing the Commands in Rules</A>.
For example, using this canned sequence:

</P>

<PRE>
define frobnicate
@echo "frobnicating target $@"
frob-step-1 $&#60; -o $@-step-1
frob-step-2 $@-step-1 -o $@
endef
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>make</CODE> will not echo the first line, the <CODE>echo</CODE> command.
But it <EM>will</EM> echo the following two command lines.

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, prefix characters on the command line that refers to
a canned sequence apply to every line in the sequence.  So the rule:

</P>

<PRE>
frob.out: frob.in
        @$(frobnicate)
</PRE>

<P>
does not echo <EM>any</EM> commands.
(See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC45">Command Echoing</A>, for a full explanation of <SAMP>`@'</SAMP>.)

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC56" HREF="make.html#TOC56">Using Empty Commands</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX411"></A>
<A NAME="IDX412"></A>

</P>
<P>
It is sometimes useful to define commands which do nothing.  This is done
simply by giving a command that consists of nothing but whitespace.  For
example:

</P>

<PRE>
target: ;
</PRE>

<P>
defines an empty command string for <TT>`target'</TT>.  You could also use a
line beginning with a tab character to define an empty command string,
but this would be confusing because such a line looks empty.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX413"></A>
You may be wondering why you would want to define a command string that
does nothing.  The only reason this is useful is to prevent a target
from getting implicit commands (from implicit rules or the
<CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> special target; see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC93">Using Implicit Rules</A> and
see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC105">Defining Last-Resort Default Rules</A>).
</P>

<P>
You may be inclined to define empty command strings for targets that are
not actual files, but only exist so that their prerequisites can be
remade.  However, this is not the best way to do that, because the
prerequisites may not be remade properly if the target file actually does exist.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC33">Phony Targets</A>, for a better way to do this.

A <STRONG>variable</STRONG> is a name defined in a makefile to represent a string
of text, called the variable's <STRONG>value</STRONG>.  These values are
substituted by explicit request into targets, prerequisites, commands,
and other parts of the makefile.  (In some other versions of <CODE>make</CODE>,
variables are called <STRONG>macros</STRONG>.)
<A NAME="IDX418"></A>

</P>
<P>
Variables and functions in all parts of a makefile are expanded when
read, except for the shell commands in rules, the right-hand sides of
variable definitions using <SAMP>`='</SAMP>, and the bodies of variable
definitions using the <CODE>define</CODE> directive.
</P>
<P>
Variables can represent lists of file names, options to pass to compilers,
programs to run, directories to look in for source files, directories to
write output in, or anything else you can imagine.

</P>
<P>
A variable name may be any sequence of characters not containing <SAMP>`:'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`#'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`='</SAMP>, or leading or trailing whitespace.  However,
variable names containing characters other than letters, numbers, and
underscores should be avoided, as they may be given special meanings in the
future, and with some shells they cannot be passed through the environment to a
sub-<CODE>make</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC52">Communicating Variables to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>).

</P>
<P>
Variable names are case-sensitive.  The names <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`FOO'</SAMP>,
and <SAMP>`Foo'</SAMP> all refer to different variables.

</P>
<P>
It is traditional to use upper case letters in variable names, but we
recommend using lower case letters for variable names that serve internal
purposes in the makefile, and reserving upper case for parameters that
control implicit rules or for parameters that the user should override with
command options (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC90">Overriding Variables</A>).

</P>
<P>
A few variables have names that are a single punctuation character or
just a few characters.  These are the <STRONG>automatic variables</STRONG>, and
they have particular specialized uses.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC101">Automatic Variables</A>.

<P>
To substitute a variable's value, write a dollar sign followed by the name
of the variable in parentheses or braces: either <SAMP>`$(foo)'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`${foo}'</SAMP> is a valid reference to the variable <CODE>foo</CODE>.  This
special significance of <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> is why you must write <SAMP>`$$'</SAMP> to have
the effect of a single dollar sign in a file name or command.

</P>
<P>
Variable references can be used in any context: targets, prerequisites,
commands, most directives, and new variable values.  Here is an
example of a common case, where a variable holds the names of all the
object files in a program:

</P>

<PRE>
objects = program.o foo.o utils.o
program : $(objects)
        cc -o program $(objects)

$(objects) : defs.h
</PRE>

<P>
Variable references work by strict textual substitution.  Thus, the rule

</P>

<PRE>
foo = c
prog.o : prog.$(foo)
        $(foo)$(foo) -$(foo) prog.$(foo)
</PRE>

<P>
could be used to compile a C program <TT>`prog.c'</TT>.  Since spaces before
the variable value are ignored in variable assignments, the value of
<CODE>foo</CODE> is precisely <SAMP>`c'</SAMP>.  (Don't actually write your makefiles
this way!)

</P>
<P>
A dollar sign followed by a character other than a dollar sign,
open-parenthesis or open-brace treats that single character as the
variable name.  Thus, you could reference the variable <CODE>x</CODE> with
<SAMP>`$x'</SAMP>.  However, this practice is strongly discouraged, except in
the case of the automatic variables (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC101">Automatic Variables</A>).

<H2><A NAME="SEC59" HREF="make.html#TOC59">The Two Flavors of Variables</A></H2>

<A NAME="IDX425"></A>
<A NAME="IDX426"></A>
<A NAME="IDX427"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are two ways that a variable in GNU <CODE>make</CODE> can have a value;
we call them the two <STRONG>flavors</STRONG> of variables.  The two flavors are
distinguished in how they are defined and in what they do when expanded.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX428"></A>
The first flavor of variable is a <STRONG>recursively expanded</STRONG> variable.
Variables of this sort are defined by lines using <SAMP>`='</SAMP>
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC64">Setting Variables</A>) or by the <CODE>define</CODE> directive
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC67">Defining Variables Verbatim</A>).  The value you specify
is installed verbatim; if it contains references to other variables,
these references are expanded whenever this variable is substituted (in
the course of expanding some other string).  When this happens, it is
called <STRONG>recursive expansion</STRONG>.
</P>
<P>
For example,

</P>

<PRE>
foo = $(bar)
bar = $(ugh)
ugh = Huh?

all:;echo $(foo)
</PRE>

<P>
will echo <SAMP>`Huh?'</SAMP>: <SAMP>`$(foo)'</SAMP> expands to <SAMP>`$(bar)'</SAMP> which
expands to <SAMP>`$(ugh)'</SAMP> which finally expands to <SAMP>`Huh?'</SAMP>.
</P>
<P>
This flavor of variable is the only sort supported by other versions of
<CODE>make</CODE>.  It has its advantages and its disadvantages.  An advantage
(most would say) is that:

</P>

<PRE>
CFLAGS = $(include_dirs) -O
include_dirs = -Ifoo -Ibar
</PRE>

<P>
will do what was intended: when <SAMP>`CFLAGS'</SAMP> is expanded in a command,
it will expand to <SAMP>`-Ifoo -Ibar -O'</SAMP>.  A major disadvantage is that you
cannot append something on the end of a variable, as in

</P>

<PRE>
CFLAGS = $(CFLAGS) -O
</PRE>

<P>
because it will cause an infinite loop in the variable expansion.
(Actually <CODE>make</CODE> detects the infinite loop and reports an error.)
<A NAME="IDX429"></A>
<A NAME="IDX430"></A>

</P>
<P>
Another disadvantage is that any functions
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC75">Functions for Transforming Text</A>)
referenced in the definition will be executed every time the variable is
expanded.  This makes <CODE>make</CODE> run slower; worse, it causes the
<CODE>wildcard</CODE> and <CODE>shell</CODE> functions to give unpredictable results
because you cannot easily control when they are called, or even how many
times.

</P>
<P>
To avoid all the problems and inconveniences of recursively expanded
variables, there is another flavor: simply expanded variables.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX431"></A>
<A NAME="IDX432"></A>
<A NAME="IDX433"></A>
<STRONG>Simply expanded variables</STRONG> are defined by lines using <SAMP>`:='</SAMP>
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC64">Setting Variables</A>).
The value of a simply expanded variable is scanned
once and for all, expanding any references to other variables and
functions, when the variable is defined.  The actual value of the simply
expanded variable is the result of expanding the text that you write.
It does not contain any references to other variables; it contains their
values <EM>as of the time this variable was defined</EM>.  Therefore,

</P>

<PRE>
x := foo
y := $(x) bar
x := later
</PRE>

<P>
is equivalent to

</P>

<PRE>
y := foo bar
x := later
</PRE>

<P>
When a simply expanded variable is referenced, its value is substituted
verbatim.

</P>
<P>
Here is a somewhat more complicated example, illustrating the use of
<SAMP>`:='</SAMP> in conjunction with the <CODE>shell</CODE> function.
(See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC83">The <CODE>shell</CODE> Function</A>.)  This example
also shows use of the variable <CODE>MAKELEVEL</CODE>, which is changed
when it is passed down from level to level.
(See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC52">Communicating Variables to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>, for information about <CODE>MAKELEVEL</CODE>.)

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX434"></A>
<A NAME="IDX435"></A>

<PRE>
ifeq (0,${MAKELEVEL})
cur-dir   := $(shell pwd)
whoami    := $(shell whoami)
host-type := $(shell arch)
MAKE := ${MAKE} host-type=${host-type} whoami=${whoami}
endif
</PRE>

<P>
An advantage of this use of <SAMP>`:='</SAMP> is that a typical
`descend into a directory' command then looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
${subdirs}:
      ${MAKE} cur-dir=${cur-dir}/$@ -C $@ all
</PRE>

<P>
Simply expanded variables generally make complicated makefile programming
more predictable because they work like variables in most programming
languages.  They allow you to redefine a variable using its own value (or
its value processed in some way by one of the expansion functions) and to
use the expansion functions much more efficiently
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC75">Functions for Transforming Text</A>).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX436"></A>
<A NAME="IDX437"></A>
<A NAME="IDX438"></A>
You can also use them to introduce controlled leading whitespace into
variable values.  Leading whitespace characters are discarded from your
input before substitution of variable references and function calls;
this means you can include leading spaces in a variable value by
protecting them with variable references, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
nullstring :=
space := $(nullstring) # end of the line
</PRE>

<P>
Here the value of the variable <CODE>space</CODE> is precisely one space.  The
comment <SAMP>`# end of the line'</SAMP> is included here just for clarity.
Since trailing space characters are <EM>not</EM> stripped from variable
values, just a space at the end of the line would have the same effect
(but be rather hard to read).  If you put whitespace at the end of a
variable value, it is a good idea to put a comment like that at the end
of the line to make your intent clear.  Conversely, if you do <EM>not</EM>
want any whitespace characters at the end of your variable value, you
must remember not to put a random comment on the end of the line after
some whitespace, such as this:

</P>

<PRE>
dir := /foo/bar    # directory to put the frobs in
</PRE>

<P>
Here the value of the variable <CODE>dir</CODE> is <SAMP>`/foo/bar    '</SAMP>
(with four trailing spaces), which was probably not the intention.
(Imagine something like <SAMP>`$(dir)/file'</SAMP> with this definition!)

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX439"></A>
<A NAME="IDX440"></A>
<A NAME="IDX441"></A>
There is another assignment operator for variables, <SAMP>`?='</SAMP>.  This
is called a conditional variable assignment operator, because it only
has an effect if the variable is not yet defined.  This statement:

</P>

<PRE>
FOO ?= bar
</PRE>

<P>
is exactly equivalent to this
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC82">The <CODE>origin</CODE> Function</A>):

</P>

<PRE>
ifeq ($(origin FOO), undefined)
  FOO = bar
endif
</PRE>

<P>
Note that a variable set to an empty value is still defined, so
<SAMP>`?='</SAMP> will not set that variable.

A <STRONG>substitution reference</STRONG> substitutes the value of a variable with
alterations that you specify.  It has the form
<SAMP>`$(<VAR>var</VAR>:<VAR>a</VAR>=<VAR>b</VAR>)'</SAMP> (or
<SAMP>`${<VAR>var</VAR>:<VAR>a</VAR>=<VAR>b</VAR>}'</SAMP>) and its meaning is to take the value
of the variable <VAR>var</VAR>, replace every <VAR>a</VAR> at the end of a word with
<VAR>b</VAR> in that value, and substitute the resulting string.

</P>
<P>
When we say "at the end of a word", we mean that <VAR>a</VAR> must appear
either followed by whitespace or at the end of the value in order to be
replaced; other occurrences of <VAR>a</VAR> in the value are unaltered.  For
example:
</P>

<PRE>
foo := a.o b.o c.o
bar := $(foo:.o=.c)
</PRE>

<P>
sets <SAMP>`bar'</SAMP> to <SAMP>`a.c b.c c.c'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC64">Setting Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
A substitution reference is actually an abbreviation for use of the
<CODE>patsubst</CODE> expansion function (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC77">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</A>).  We provide
substitution references as well as <CODE>patsubst</CODE> for compatibility with
other implementations of <CODE>make</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX449"></A>
Another type of substitution reference lets you use the full power of
the <CODE>patsubst</CODE> function.  It has the same form
<SAMP>`$(<VAR>var</VAR>:<VAR>a</VAR>=<VAR>b</VAR>)'</SAMP> described above, except that now
<VAR>a</VAR> must contain a single <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> character.  This case is
equivalent to <SAMP>`$(patsubst <VAR>a</VAR>,<VAR>b</VAR>,$(<VAR>var</VAR>))'</SAMP>.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC77">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</A>,
for a description of the <CODE>patsubst</CODE> function.
</P>

<PRE>
For example:

foo := a.o b.o c.o
bar := $(foo:%.o=%.c)
</PRE>

<P>
sets <SAMP>`bar'</SAMP> to <SAMP>`a.c b.c c.c'</SAMP>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC62" HREF="make.html#TOC62">Computed Variable Names</A></H3>

<A NAME="IDX454"></A>

<A NAME="IDX456"></A>

</P>
<P>
Computed variable names are a complicated concept needed only for
sophisticated makefile programming.  For most purposes you need not
consider them, except to know that making a variable with a dollar sign
in its name might have strange results.  However, if you are the type
that wants to understand everything, or you are actually interested in
what they do, read on.

</P>
<P>
Variables may be referenced inside the name of a variable.  This is
called a <STRONG>computed variable name</STRONG> or a <STRONG>nested variable
reference</STRONG>.  For example,

</P>

<PRE>
x = y
y = z
a := $($(x))
</PRE>

<P>
defines <CODE>a</CODE> as <SAMP>`z'</SAMP>: the <SAMP>`$(x)'</SAMP> inside <SAMP>`$($(x))'</SAMP> expands
to <SAMP>`y'</SAMP>, so <SAMP>`$($(x))'</SAMP> expands to <SAMP>`$(y)'</SAMP> which in turn expands
to <SAMP>`z'</SAMP>.  Here the name of the variable to reference is not stated
explicitly; it is computed by expansion of <SAMP>`$(x)'</SAMP>.  The reference
<SAMP>`$(x)'</SAMP> here is nested within the outer variable reference.

</P>
<P>
The previous example shows two levels of nesting, but any number of levels
is possible.  For example, here are three levels:

</P>

<PRE>
x = y
y = z
z = u
a := $($($(x)))
</PRE>

<P>
Here the innermost <SAMP>`$(x)'</SAMP> expands to <SAMP>`y'</SAMP>, so <SAMP>`$($(x))'</SAMP>
expands to <SAMP>`$(y)'</SAMP> which in turn expands to <SAMP>`z'</SAMP>; now we have
<SAMP>`$(z)'</SAMP>, which becomes <SAMP>`u'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
References to recursively-expanded variables within a variable name are
reexpanded in the usual fashion.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
x = $(y)
y = z
z = Hello
a := $($(x))
</PRE>

<P>
defines <CODE>a</CODE> as <SAMP>`Hello'</SAMP>: <SAMP>`$($(x))'</SAMP> becomes <SAMP>`$($(y))'</SAMP>
which becomes <SAMP>`$(z)'</SAMP> which becomes <SAMP>`Hello'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Nested variable references can also contain modified references and
function invocations (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC75">Functions for Transforming Text</A>),
just like any other reference.
For example, using the <CODE>subst</CODE> function
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC77">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</A>):

</P>

<PRE>
x = variable1
variable2 := Hello
y = $(subst 1,2,$(x))
z = y
a := $($($(z)))
</PRE>

<P>
eventually defines <CODE>a</CODE> as <SAMP>`Hello'</SAMP>.  It is doubtful that anyone
would ever want to write a nested reference as convoluted as this one, but
it works: <SAMP>`$($($(z)))'</SAMP> expands to <SAMP>`$($(y))'</SAMP> which becomes
<SAMP>`$($(subst 1,2,$(x)))'</SAMP>.  This gets the value <SAMP>`variable1'</SAMP> from
<CODE>x</CODE> and changes it by substitution to <SAMP>`variable2'</SAMP>, so that the
entire string becomes <SAMP>`$(variable2)'</SAMP>, a simple variable reference
whose value is <SAMP>`Hello'</SAMP>.
</P>
<P>
A computed variable name need not consist entirely of a single variable
reference.  It can contain several variable references, as well as some
invariant text.  For example,

</P>

<PRE>
a_dirs := dira dirb
1_dirs := dir1 dir2

a_files := filea fileb
1_files := file1 file2

ifeq "$(use_a)" "yes"
a1 := a
else
a1 := 1
endif

ifeq "$(use_dirs)" "yes"
df := dirs
else
df := files
endif

dirs := $($(a1)_$(df))
</PRE>

<P>
will give <CODE>dirs</CODE> the same value as <CODE>a_dirs</CODE>, <CODE>1_dirs</CODE>,
<CODE>a_files</CODE> or <CODE>1_files</CODE> depending on the settings of <CODE>use_a</CODE>
and <CODE>use_dirs</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
Computed variable names can also be used in substitution references:

</P>

<PRE>
a_objects := a.o b.o c.o
1_objects := 1.o 2.o 3.o

sources := $($(a1)_objects:.o=.c)
</PRE>

<P>
defines <CODE>sources</CODE> as either <SAMP>`a.c b.c c.c'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`1.c 2.c 3.c'</SAMP>,
depending on the value of <CODE>a1</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The only restriction on this sort of use of nested variable references
is that they cannot specify part of the name of a function to be called.
This is because the test for a recognized function name is done before
the expansion of nested references.  For example,

</P>

<PRE>
ifdef do_sort
func := sort
else
func := strip
endif

bar := a d b g q c

foo := $($(func) $(bar))
</PRE>

<P>
attempts to give <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP> the value of the variable <SAMP>`sort a d b g
q c'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`strip a d b g q c'</SAMP>, rather than giving <SAMP>`a d b g q c'</SAMP>
as the argument to either the <CODE>sort</CODE> or the <CODE>strip</CODE> function.
This restriction could be removed in the future if that change is shown
to be a good idea.

</P>
<P>
You can also use computed variable names in the left-hand side of a
variable assignment, or in a <CODE>define</CODE> directive, as in:

</P>

<PRE>
dir = foo
$(dir)_sources := $(wildcard $(dir)/*.c)
define $(dir)_print
lpr $($(dir)_sources)
endef
</PRE>

<P>
This example defines the variables <SAMP>`dir'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`foo_sources'</SAMP>, and
<SAMP>`foo_print'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Note that <STRONG>nested variable references</STRONG> are quite different from
<STRONG>recursively expanded variables</STRONG>
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC59">The Two Flavors of Variables</A>), though both are
used together in complex ways when doing makefile programming.

Variables can get values in several different ways:

<UL>
<LI>

You can specify an overriding value when you run <CODE>make</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC90">Overriding Variables</A>.

<LI>

You can specify a value in the makefile, either
with an assignment (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC64">Setting Variables</A>) or with a
verbatim definition (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC67">Defining Variables Verbatim</A>).
<LI>

Variables in the environment become <CODE>make</CODE> variables.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC68">Variables from the Environment</A>.

Several <STRONG>automatic</STRONG> variables are given new values for each rule.
Each of these has a single conventional use.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC101">Automatic Variables</A>.

Several variables have constant initial values.

</P>
<P>
To set a variable from the makefile, write a line starting with the
variable name followed by <SAMP>`='</SAMP> or <SAMP>`:='</SAMP>.  Whatever follows the
<SAMP>`='</SAMP> or <SAMP>`:='</SAMP> on the line becomes the value.  For example,

</P>

<PRE>
objects = main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o
</PRE>

<P>
defines a variable named <CODE>objects</CODE>.  Whitespace around the variable
name and immediately after the <SAMP>`='</SAMP> is ignored.

</P>
<P>
Variables defined with <SAMP>`='</SAMP> are <STRONG>recursively expanded</STRONG> variables.
Variables defined with <SAMP>`:='</SAMP> are <STRONG>simply expanded</STRONG> variables; these
definitions can contain variable references which will be expanded before
the definition is made.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC59">The Two Flavors of Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
The variable name may contain function and variable references, which
are expanded when the line is read to find the actual variable name to use.

</P>
<P>
There is no limit on the length of the value of a variable except the
amount of swapping space on the computer.  When a variable definition is
long, it is a good idea to break it into several lines by inserting
backslash-newline at convenient places in the definition.  This will not
affect the functioning of <CODE>make</CODE>, but it will make the makefile easier
to read.

</P>
<P>
Most variable names are considered to have the empty string as a value if
you have never set them.  Several variables have built-in initial values
that are not empty, but you can set them in the usual ways
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC96">Variables Used by Implicit Rules</A>).
Several special variables are set
automatically to a new value for each rule; these are called the
<STRONG>automatic</STRONG> variables (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC101">Automatic Variables</A>).

</P>
<P>
If you'd like a variable to be set to a value only if it's not already
set, then you can use the shorthand operator <SAMP>`?='</SAMP> instead of
<SAMP>`='</SAMP>.  These two settings of the variable <SAMP>`FOO'</SAMP> are identical
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC82">The <CODE>origin</CODE> Function</A>):

</P>

<PRE>
FOO ?= bar
</PRE>

<P>
and

</P>

<PRE>
ifeq ($(origin FOO), undefined)
FOO = bar
endif
</PRE>

<P>
Often it is useful to add more text to the value of a variable already defined.
You do this with a line containing <SAMP>`+='</SAMP>, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
objects += another.o
</PRE>

<P>
This takes the value of the variable <CODE>objects</CODE>, and adds the text
<SAMP>`another.o'</SAMP> to it (preceded by a single space).  Thus:

</P>

<PRE>
objects = main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o
objects += another.o
</PRE>

<P>
sets <CODE>objects</CODE> to <SAMP>`main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o another.o'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Using <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> is similar to:

</P>

<PRE>
objects = main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o
objects := $(objects) another.o
</PRE>

<P>
but differs in ways that become important when you use more complex values.

</P>
<P>
When the variable in question has not been defined before, <SAMP>`+='</SAMP>
acts just like normal <SAMP>`='</SAMP>: it defines a recursively-expanded
variable.  However, when there <EM>is</EM> a previous definition, exactly
what <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> does depends on what flavor of variable you defined
originally.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC59">The Two Flavors of Variables</A>, for an
explanation of the two flavors of variables.

</P>
<P>
When you add to a variable's value with <SAMP>`+='</SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE> acts
essentially as if you had included the extra text in the initial
definition of the variable.  If you defined it first with <SAMP>`:='</SAMP>,
making it a simply-expanded variable, <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> adds to that
simply-expanded definition, and expands the new text before appending it
to the old value just as <SAMP>`:='</SAMP> does
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC64">Setting Variables</A>, for a full explanation of <SAMP>`:='</SAMP>).
In fact,

</P>

<PRE>
variable := value
variable += more
</PRE>

<P>
is exactly equivalent to:

</P>
<P>

<PRE>
variable := value
variable := $(variable) more
</PRE>

<P>
On the other hand, when you use <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> with a variable that you defined
first to be recursively-expanded using plain <SAMP>`='</SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE> does
something a bit different.  Recall that when you define a
recursively-expanded variable, <CODE>make</CODE> does not expand the value you set
for variable and function references immediately.  Instead it stores the text
verbatim, and saves these variable and function references to be expanded
later, when you refer to the new variable (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC59">The Two Flavors of Variables</A>).  When you use <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> on a recursively-expanded variable,
it is this unexpanded text to which <CODE>make</CODE> appends the new text you
specify.

</P>

<PRE>
variable = value
variable += more
</PRE>

<P>
is roughly equivalent to:

</P>

<PRE>
temp = value
variable = $(temp) more
</PRE>

<P>
except that of course it never defines a variable called <CODE>temp</CODE>.
The importance of this comes when the variable's old value contains
variable references.  Take this common example:

</P>

<PRE>
CFLAGS = $(includes) -O
...
CFLAGS += -pg # enable profiling
</PRE>

<P>
The first line defines the <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> variable with a reference to another
variable, <CODE>includes</CODE>.  (<CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> is used by the rules for C
compilation; see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC95">Catalogue of Implicit Rules</A>.)
Using <SAMP>`='</SAMP> for the definition makes <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> a recursively-expanded
variable, meaning <SAMP>`$(includes) -O'</SAMP> is <EM>not</EM> expanded when
<CODE>make</CODE> processes the definition of <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>.  Thus, <CODE>includes</CODE>
need not be defined yet for its value to take effect.  It only has to be
defined before any reference to <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>.  If we tried to append to the
value of <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> without using <SAMP>`+='</SAMP>, we might do it like this:

</P>

<PRE>
CFLAGS := $(CFLAGS) -pg # enable profiling
</PRE>

<P>
This is pretty close, but not quite what we want.  Using <SAMP>`:='</SAMP>
redefines <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> as a simply-expanded variable; this means
<CODE>make</CODE> expands the text <SAMP>`$(CFLAGS) -pg'</SAMP> before setting the
variable.  If <CODE>includes</CODE> is not yet defined, we get <SAMP>` -O
-pg'</SAMP>, and a later definition of <CODE>includes</CODE> will have no effect.
Conversely, by using <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> we set <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> to the
<EM>unexpanded</EM> value <SAMP>`$(includes) -O -pg'</SAMP>.  Thus we preserve
the reference to <CODE>includes</CODE>, so if that variable gets defined at
any later point, a reference like <SAMP>`$(CFLAGS)'</SAMP> still uses its
value.

<P>
If a variable has been set with a command argument
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC90">Overriding Variables</A>),
then ordinary assignments in the makefile are ignored.  If you want to set
the variable in the makefile even though it was set with a command
argument, you can use an <CODE>override</CODE> directive, which is a line that
looks like this:
</P>

<PRE>
override <VAR>variable</VAR> = <VAR>value</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
or

</P>

<PRE>
override <VAR>variable</VAR> := <VAR>value</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
To append more text to a variable defined on the command line, use:

</P>

<PRE>
override <VAR>variable</VAR> += <VAR>more text</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC65">Appending More Text to Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>override</CODE> directive was not invented for escalation in the war
between makefiles and command arguments.  It was invented so you can alter
and add to values that the user specifies with command arguments.

</P>
<P>
For example, suppose you always want the <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> switch when you run the
C compiler, but you would like to allow the user to specify the other
switches with a command argument just as usual.  You could use this
<CODE>override</CODE> directive:

</P>

<PRE>
override CFLAGS += -g
</PRE>

<P>
You can also use <CODE>override</CODE> directives with <CODE>define</CODE> directives.
This is done as you might expect:

</P>

<PRE>
override define foo
bar
endef
</PRE>

<P>
See the next section for information about <CODE>define</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX472"></A>
<A NAME="IDX473"></A>
<A NAME="IDX474"></A>

</P>
<P>
Another way to set the value of a variable is to use the <CODE>define</CODE>
directive.  This directive has an unusual syntax which allows newline
characters to be included in the value, which is convenient for defining
canned sequences of commands
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC55">Defining Canned Command Sequences</A>).

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>define</CODE> directive is followed on the same line by the name of the
variable and nothing more.  The value to give the variable appears on the
following lines.  The end of the value is marked by a line containing just
the word <CODE>endef</CODE>.  Aside from this difference in syntax, <CODE>define</CODE>
works just like <SAMP>`='</SAMP>: it creates a recursively-expanded variable
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC59">The Two Flavors of Variables</A>).
The variable name may contain function and variable references, which
are expanded when the directive is read to find the actual variable name
to use.

</P>

<PRE>
define two-lines
echo foo
echo $(bar)
endef
</PRE>

<P>
The value in an ordinary assignment cannot contain a newline; but the
newlines that separate the lines of the value in a <CODE>define</CODE> become
part of the variable's value (except for the final newline which precedes
the <CODE>endef</CODE> and is not considered part of the value).
</P>
<P>
The previous example is functionally equivalent to this:

</P>

<PRE>
two-lines = echo foo; echo $(bar)
</PRE>

<P>
since two commands separated by semicolon behave much like two separate
shell commands.  However, note that using two separate lines means
<CODE>make</CODE> will invoke the shell twice, running an independent subshell
for each line.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC46">Command Execution</A>.

</P>
<P>
If you want variable definitions made with <CODE>define</CODE> to take
precedence over command-line variable definitions, you can use the
<CODE>override</CODE> directive together with <CODE>define</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
override define two-lines
foo
$(bar)
endef
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC66">The <CODE>override</CODE> Directive</A>.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX475"></A>
<A NAME="IDX476"></A>
Variables in <CODE>make</CODE> can come from the environment in which
<CODE>make</CODE> is run.  Every environment variable that <CODE>make</CODE> sees when
it starts up is transformed into a <CODE>make</CODE> variable with the same name
and value.  But an explicit assignment in the makefile, or with a command
argument, overrides the environment.  (If the <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> flag is specified,
then values from the environment override assignments in the makefile.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC92">Summary of Options</A>.
But this is not recommended practice.)

</P>
<P>
Thus, by setting the variable <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> in your environment, you can
cause all C compilations in most makefiles to use the compiler switches you
prefer.  This is safe for variables with standard or conventional meanings
because you know that no makefile will use them for other things.  (But
this is not totally reliable; some makefiles set <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> explicitly
and therefore are not affected by the value in the environment.)

</P>
<P>
When <CODE>make</CODE> is invoked recursively, variables defined in the
outer invocation can be passed to inner invocations through the
environment (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC50">Recursive Use of <CODE>make</CODE></A>).  By
default, only variables that came from the environment or the command
line are passed to recursive invocations.  You can use the
<CODE>export</CODE> directive to pass other variables.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC52">Communicating Variables to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>, for full details.

</P>
<P>
Other use of variables from the environment is not recommended.  It is not
wise for makefiles to depend for their functioning on environment variables
set up outside their control, since this would cause different users to get
different results from the same makefile.  This is against the whole
purpose of most makefiles.

</P>
<P>
Such problems would be especially likely with the variable <CODE>SHELL</CODE>,
which is normally present in the environment to specify the user's choice
of interactive shell.  It would be very undesirable for this choice to
affect <CODE>make</CODE>.  So <CODE>make</CODE> ignores the environment value of
<CODE>SHELL</CODE> (except on MS-DOS and MS-Windows, where <CODE>SHELL</CODE> is
usually not set.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC46">Command Execution</A>.)

<P>
<A NAME="IDX477"></A>
<A NAME="IDX478"></A>

</P>
<P>
Variable values in <CODE>make</CODE> are usually global; that is, they are the
same regardless of where they are evaluated (unless they're reset, of
course).  One exception to that is automatic variables
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC101">Automatic Variables</A>).

</P>
<P>
The other exception is <STRONG>target-specific variable values</STRONG>.  This
feature allows you to define different values for the same variable,
based on the target that <CODE>make</CODE> is currently building.  As with
automatic variables, these values are only available within the context
of a target's command script (and in other target-specific assignments).

</P>
<P>
Set a target-specific variable value like this:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>target</VAR> ... : <VAR>variable-assignment</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
or like this:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>target</VAR> ... : override <VAR>variable-assignment</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
Multiple <VAR>target</VAR> values create a target-specific variable value for
each member of the target list individually.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>variable-assignment</VAR> can be any valid form of assignment;
recursive (<SAMP>`='</SAMP>), static (<SAMP>`:='</SAMP>), appending (<SAMP>`+='</SAMP>), or
conditional (<SAMP>`?='</SAMP>).  All variables that appear within the
<VAR>variable-assignment</VAR> are evaluated within the context of the
target: thus, any previously-defined target-specific variable values
will be in effect.  Note that this variable is actually distinct from
any "global" value: the two variables do not have to have the same
flavor (recursive vs. static).

</P>
<P>
Target-specific variables have the same priority as any other makefile
variable.  Variables provided on the command-line (and in the
environment if the <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> option is in force) will take precedence.
Specifying the <CODE>override</CODE> directive will allow the target-specific
variable value to be preferred.

</P>
<P>
There is one more special feature of target-specific variables: when you
define a target-specific variable, that variable value is also in effect
for all prerequisites of this target (unless those prerequisites override
it with their own target-specific variable value).  So, for example, a
statement like this:

</P>

<PRE>
prog : CFLAGS = -g
prog : prog.o foo.o bar.o
</PRE>

<P>
will set <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> to <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> in the command script for
<TT>`prog'</TT>, but it will also set <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> to <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> in the
command scripts that create <TT>`prog.o'</TT>, <TT>`foo.o'</TT>, and
<TT>`bar.o'</TT>, and any command scripts which create their prerequisites.

</P>
<P>
In addition to target-specific variable values (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC69">Target-specific Variable Values</A>), GNU <CODE>make</CODE> supports
pattern-specific variable values.  In this form, a variable is defined
for any target that matches the pattern specified.  Variables defined in
this way are searched after any target-specific variables defined
explicitly for that target, and before target-specific variables defined
for the parent target.

</P>
<P>
Set a pattern-specific variable value like this:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>pattern</VAR> ... : <VAR>variable-assignment</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
or like this:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>pattern</VAR> ... : override <VAR>variable-assignment</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>pattern</VAR> is a %-pattern.  As with target-specific variable
values, multiple <VAR>pattern</VAR> values create a pattern-specific variable
value for each pattern individually.  The <VAR>variable-assignment</VAR> can
be any valid form of assignment.  Any command-line variable setting will
take precedence, unless <CODE>override</CODE> is specified.

</P>
<P>
For example:

</P>

<PRE>
%.o : CFLAGS = -O
</PRE>

<P>
will assign <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> the value of <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> for all targets
matching the pattern <CODE>%.o</CODE>.

<H1><A NAME="SEC71" HREF="make.html#TOC71">Conditional Parts of Makefiles</A></H1>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX481"></A>
A <STRONG>conditional</STRONG> causes part of a makefile to be obeyed or ignored
depending on the values of variables.  Conditionals can compare the
value of one variable to another, or the value of a variable to
a constant string.  Conditionals control what <CODE>make</CODE> actually
"sees" in the makefile, so they <EM>cannot</EM> be used to control shell
commands at the time of execution.
</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC72" HREF="make.html#TOC72">Example of a Conditional</A></H2>

<P>
The following example of a conditional tells <CODE>make</CODE> to use one set
of libraries if the <CODE>CC</CODE> variable is <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP>, and a different
set of libraries otherwise.  It works by controlling which of two
command lines will be used as the command for a rule.  The result is
that <SAMP>`CC=gcc'</SAMP> as an argument to <CODE>make</CODE> changes not only which
compiler is used but also which libraries are linked.

</P>

<PRE>
libs_for_gcc = -lgnu
normal_libs =

foo: $(objects)
ifeq ($(CC),gcc)
        $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(libs_for_gcc)
else
        $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(normal_libs)
endif
</PRE>

<P>
This conditional uses three directives: one <CODE>ifeq</CODE>, one <CODE>else</CODE>
and one <CODE>endif</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>ifeq</CODE> directive begins the conditional, and specifies the
condition.  It contains two arguments, separated by a comma and surrounded
by parentheses.  Variable substitution is performed on both arguments and
then they are compared.  The lines of the makefile following the
<CODE>ifeq</CODE> are obeyed if the two arguments match; otherwise they are
ignored.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>else</CODE> directive causes the following lines to be obeyed if the
previous conditional failed.  In the example above, this means that the
second alternative linking command is used whenever the first alternative
is not used.  It is optional to have an <CODE>else</CODE> in a conditional.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>endif</CODE> directive ends the conditional.  Every conditional must
end with an <CODE>endif</CODE>.  Unconditional makefile text follows.

</P>
<P>
As this example illustrates, conditionals work at the textual level:
the lines of the conditional are treated as part of the makefile, or
ignored, according to the condition.  This is why the larger syntactic
units of the makefile, such as rules, may cross the beginning or the
end of the conditional.

</P>
<P>
When the variable <CODE>CC</CODE> has the value <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP>, the above example has
this effect:

</P>

<PRE>
foo: $(objects)
        $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(libs_for_gcc)
</PRE>

<P>
When the variable <CODE>CC</CODE> has any other value, the effect is this:

</P>

<PRE>
foo: $(objects)
        $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(normal_libs)
</PRE>

<P>
Equivalent results can be obtained in another way by conditionalizing a
variable assignment and then using the variable unconditionally:

</P>

<PRE>
libs_for_gcc = -lgnu
normal_libs =

ifeq ($(CC),gcc)
  libs=$(libs_for_gcc)
else
  libs=$(normal_libs)
endif

foo: $(objects)
        $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(libs)
</PRE>

<VAR>text-if-true</VAR>

</PRE>

<P>
The <VAR>text-if-true</VAR> may be any lines of text, to be considered as part
of the makefile if the condition is true.  If the condition is false, no
text is used instead.

</P>
<P>
The syntax of a complex conditional is as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>conditional-directive</VAR>
<VAR>text-if-true</VAR>
else
<VAR>text-if-false</VAR>
endif
</PRE>

If the condition is true, <VAR>text-if-true</VAR> is used; otherwise,
<VAR>text-if-false</VAR> is used instead.  The <VAR>text-if-false</VAR> can be any
number of lines of text.

</P>
<P>
The syntax of the <VAR>conditional-directive</VAR> is the same whether the
conditional is simple or complex.  There are four different directives that
test different conditions.  Here is a table of them:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>ifeq (<VAR>arg1</VAR>, <VAR>arg2</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>ifeq '<VAR>arg1</VAR>' '<VAR>arg2</VAR>'</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>ifeq "<VAR>arg1</VAR>" "<VAR>arg2</VAR>"</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>ifeq "<VAR>arg1</VAR>" '<VAR>arg2</VAR>'</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>ifeq '<VAR>arg1</VAR>' "<VAR>arg2</VAR>"</CODE>
<DD>
Expand all variable references in <VAR>arg1</VAR> and <VAR>arg2</VAR> and
compare them.  If they are identical, the <VAR>text-if-true</VAR> is
effective; otherwise, the <VAR>text-if-false</VAR>, if any, is effective.

Often you want to test if a variable has a non-empty value.  When the
value results from complex expansions of variables and functions,
expansions you would consider empty may actually contain whitespace
characters and thus are not seen as empty.  However, you can use the
<CODE>strip</CODE> function (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC77">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</A>) to avoid interpreting
whitespace as a non-empty value.  For example:


<PRE>
ifeq ($(strip $(foo)),)
<VAR>text-if-empty</VAR>
endif
</PRE>

will evaluate <VAR>text-if-empty</VAR> even if the expansion of
<CODE>$(foo)</CODE> contains whitespace characters.

<DT><CODE>ifneq (<VAR>arg1</VAR>, <VAR>arg2</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>ifneq '<VAR>arg1</VAR>' '<VAR>arg2</VAR>'</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>ifneq "<VAR>arg1</VAR>" "<VAR>arg2</VAR>"</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>ifneq "<VAR>arg1</VAR>" '<VAR>arg2</VAR>'</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>ifneq '<VAR>arg1</VAR>' "<VAR>arg2</VAR>"</CODE>
<DD>
Expand all variable references in <VAR>arg1</VAR> and <VAR>arg2</VAR> and
compare them.  If they are different, the <VAR>text-if-true</VAR> is
effective; otherwise, the <VAR>text-if-false</VAR>, if any, is effective.

<DT><CODE>ifdef <VAR>variable-name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
If the variable <VAR>variable-name</VAR> has a non-empty value, the
<VAR>text-if-true</VAR> is effective; otherwise, the <VAR>text-if-false</VAR>,
if any, is effective.  Variables that have never been defined have an
empty value.

Note that <CODE>ifdef</CODE> only tests whether a variable has a value.  It
does not expand the variable to see if that value is nonempty.
Consequently, tests using <CODE>ifdef</CODE> return true for all definitions
except those like <CODE>foo =</CODE>.  To test for an empty value, use
<CODE>ifeq ($(foo),)</CODE>.  For example,


<PRE>
bar =
foo = $(bar)
ifdef foo
frobozz = yes
else
frobozz = no

Extra spaces are allowed and ignored at the beginning of the conditional

The other two directives that play a part in a conditional are <CODE>else</CODE>

<P>
Conditionals affect which lines of the makefile <CODE>make</CODE> uses.  If
the condition is true, <CODE>make</CODE> reads the lines of the
<VAR>text-if-true</VAR> as part of the makefile; if the condition is false,
<CODE>make</CODE> ignores those lines completely.  It follows that syntactic
units of the makefile, such as rules, may safely be split across the
beginning or the end of the conditional.
</P>
<P>
<CODE>make</CODE> evaluates conditionals when it reads a makefile.
Consequently, you cannot use automatic variables in the tests of
conditionals because they are not defined until commands are run
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC101">Automatic Variables</A>).

</P>
<P>
To prevent intolerable confusion, it is not permitted to start a
conditional in one makefile and end it in another.  However, you may
write an <CODE>include</CODE> directive within a conditional, provided you do
not attempt to terminate the conditional inside the included file.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC74" HREF="make.html#TOC74">Conditionals that Test Flags</A></H2>

<P>
You can write a conditional that tests <CODE>make</CODE> command flags such as
<SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> by using the variable <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> together with the
<CODE>findstring</CODE> function
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC77">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</A>).
This is useful when <CODE>touch</CODE> is not enough to make a file appear up
to date.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>findstring</CODE> function determines whether one string appears as a
substring of another.  If you want to test for the <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> flag,
use <SAMP>`t'</SAMP> as the first string and the value of <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> as
the other.

</P>
<P>
For example, here is how to arrange to use <SAMP>`ranlib -t'</SAMP> to finish
marking an archive file up to date:

</P>

<PRE>
archive.a: ...
ifneq (,$(findstring t,$(MAKEFLAGS)))
        +touch archive.a
        +ranlib -t archive.a
else
        ranlib archive.a

The <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> prefix marks those command lines as "recursive" so

A function call resembles a variable reference.  It looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
$(<VAR>function</VAR> <VAR>arguments</VAR>)
</PRE>

<P>
or like this:

</P>

<PRE>
${<VAR>function</VAR> <VAR>arguments</VAR>}
</PRE>

<P>
Here <VAR>function</VAR> is a function name; one of a short list of names
that are part of <CODE>make</CODE>.  You can also essentially create your own
functions by using the <CODE>call</CODE> builtin function.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>arguments</VAR> are the arguments of the function.  They are
separated from the function name by one or more spaces or tabs, and if
there is more than one argument, then they are separated by commas.
Such whitespace and commas are not part of an argument's value.  The
delimiters which you use to surround the function call, whether
parentheses or braces, can appear in an argument only in matching pairs;
the other kind of delimiters may appear singly.  If the arguments
themselves contain other function calls or variable references, it is
wisest to use the same kind of delimiters for all the references; write
<SAMP>`$(subst a,b,$(x))'</SAMP>, not <SAMP>`$(subst a,b,${x})'</SAMP>.  This
is because it is clearer, and because only one type of delimiter is
matched to find the end of the reference.

</P>
<P>
The text written for each argument is processed by substitution of
variables and function calls to produce the argument value, which
is the text on which the function acts.  The substitution is done in the
order in which the arguments appear.

</P>
<P>
Commas and unmatched parentheses or braces cannot appear in the text of an
argument as written; leading spaces cannot appear in the text of the first
argument as written.  These characters can be put into the argument value
by variable substitution.  First define variables <CODE>comma</CODE> and
<CODE>space</CODE> whose values are isolated comma and space characters, then
substitute these variables where such characters are wanted, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
comma:= ,
empty:=
space:= $(empty) $(empty)
foo:= a b c
bar:= $(subst $(space),$(comma),$(foo))
# bar is now `a,b,c'.
</PRE>

Here the <CODE>subst</CODE> function replaces each space with a comma, through
the value of <CODE>foo</CODE>, and substitutes the result.

Here are some functions that operate on strings:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>$(subst <VAR>from</VAR>,<VAR>to</VAR>,<VAR>text</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX494"></A>
Performs a textual replacement on the text <VAR>text</VAR>: each occurrence
of <VAR>from</VAR> is replaced by <VAR>to</VAR>.  The result is substituted for
the function call.  For example,


<PRE>
$(subst ee,EE,feet on the street)
</PRE>

substitutes the string <SAMP>`fEEt on the strEEt'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>$(patsubst <VAR>pattern</VAR>,<VAR>replacement</VAR>,<VAR>text</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX495"></A>
Finds whitespace-separated words in <VAR>text</VAR> that match
<VAR>pattern</VAR> and replaces them with <VAR>replacement</VAR>.  Here
<VAR>pattern</VAR> may contain a <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> which acts as a wildcard,
matching any number of any characters within a word.  If
<VAR>replacement</VAR> also contains a <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>, the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> is replaced
by the text that matched the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> in <VAR>pattern</VAR>.
<A NAME="IDX496"></A>
<A NAME="IDX497"></A>
<A NAME="IDX498"></A>
<A NAME="IDX499"></A>
<A NAME="IDX500"></A>
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters in <CODE>patsubst</CODE> function invocations can be
quoted with preceding backslashes (<SAMP>`\'</SAMP>).  Backslashes that would
otherwise quote <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters can be quoted with more backslashes.
Backslashes that quote <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters or other backslashes are
removed from the pattern before it is compared file names or has a stem
substituted into it.  Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> characters go unmolested.  For example, the pattern
<TT>`the\%weird\\%pattern\\'</TT> has <SAMP>`the%weird\'</SAMP> preceding the
operative <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> character, and <SAMP>`pattern\\'</SAMP> following it.  The
final two backslashes are left alone because they cannot affect any
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> character.
Whitespace between words is folded into single space characters;
leading and trailing whitespace is discarded.

For example,


<PRE>
$(patsubst %.c,%.o,x.c.c bar.c)
</PRE>

produces the value <SAMP>`x.c.o bar.o'</SAMP>.

Substitution references (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC61">Substitution References</A>) are a simpler way to get the effect of the <CODE>patsubst</CODE>
function:


<PRE>
$(<VAR>var</VAR>:<VAR>pattern</VAR>=<VAR>replacement</VAR>)
</PRE>

is equivalent to


<PRE>
$(patsubst <VAR>pattern</VAR>,<VAR>replacement</VAR>,$(<VAR>var</VAR>))
</PRE>

The second shorthand simplifies one of the most common uses of
<CODE>patsubst</CODE>: replacing the suffix at the end of file names.


<PRE>
$(<VAR>var</VAR>:<VAR>suffix</VAR>=<VAR>replacement</VAR>)
</PRE>

is equivalent to


<PRE>
$(patsubst %<VAR>suffix</VAR>,%<VAR>replacement</VAR>,$(<VAR>var</VAR>))
</PRE>

For example, you might have a list of object files:


<PRE>
objects = foo.o bar.o baz.o
</PRE>

To get the list of corresponding source files, you could simply write:


<PRE>
$(objects:.o=.c)
</PRE>

instead of using the general form:


<PRE>
$(patsubst %.o,%.c,$(objects))
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>$(strip <VAR>string</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX501"></A>
<A NAME="IDX502"></A>
<A NAME="IDX503"></A>
<A NAME="IDX504"></A>
Removes leading and trailing whitespace from <VAR>string</VAR> and replaces
each internal sequence of one or more whitespace characters with a
single space.  Thus, <SAMP>`$(strip a b  c )'</SAMP> results in <SAMP>`a b c'</SAMP>.

The function <CODE>strip</CODE> can be very useful when used in conjunction
with conditionals.  When comparing something with the empty string
<SAMP>`'</SAMP> using <CODE>ifeq</CODE> or <CODE>ifneq</CODE>, you usually want a string of
just whitespace to match the empty string (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC71">Conditional Parts of Makefiles</A>).

Thus, the following may fail to have the desired results:


<PRE>
.PHONY: all
ifneq   "$(needs_made)" ""
all: $(needs_made)
else
all:;@echo 'Nothing to make!'
endif
</PRE>

Replacing the variable reference <SAMP>`$(needs_made)'</SAMP> with the
function call <SAMP>`$(strip $(needs_made))'</SAMP> in the <CODE>ifneq</CODE>
directive would make it more robust.
<DT><CODE>$(findstring <VAR>find</VAR>,<VAR>in</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX505"></A>
<A NAME="IDX506"></A>
<A NAME="IDX507"></A>
<A NAME="IDX508"></A>
Searches <VAR>in</VAR> for an occurrence of <VAR>find</VAR>.  If it occurs, the
value is <VAR>find</VAR>; otherwise, the value is empty.  You can use this
function in a conditional to test for the presence of a specific
substring in a given string.  Thus, the two examples,


<PRE>
$(findstring a,a b c)
$(findstring a,b c)
</PRE>

produce the values <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`'</SAMP> (the empty string),
respectively.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC74">Conditionals that Test Flags</A>, for a practical application of
<CODE>findstring</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX509"></A>
<A NAME="IDX510"></A>

<DT><CODE>$(filter <VAR>pattern</VAR>...,<VAR>text</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Returns all whitespace-separated words in <VAR>text</VAR> that <EM>do</EM> match
any of the <VAR>pattern</VAR> words, removing any words that <EM>do not</EM>
match.  The patterns are written using <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>, just like the patterns
used in the <CODE>patsubst</CODE> function above.
The <CODE>filter</CODE> function can be used to separate out different types
of strings (such as file names) in a variable.  For example:


<PRE>
sources := foo.c bar.c baz.s ugh.h
foo: $(sources)
        cc $(filter %.c %.s,$(sources)) -o foo
</PRE>

says that <TT>`foo'</TT> depends of <TT>`foo.c'</TT>, <TT>`bar.c'</TT>,
<TT>`baz.s'</TT> and <TT>`ugh.h'</TT> but only <TT>`foo.c'</TT>, <TT>`bar.c'</TT> and
<TT>`baz.s'</TT> should be specified in the command to the
compiler.
<DT><CODE>$(filter-out <VAR>pattern</VAR>...,<VAR>text</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX512"></A>
<A NAME="IDX513"></A>
<A NAME="IDX514"></A>
Returns all whitespace-separated words in <VAR>text</VAR> that <EM>do not</EM>
match any of the <VAR>pattern</VAR> words, removing the words that <EM>do</EM>
match one or more.  This is the exact opposite of the <CODE>filter</CODE>
function.
Removes all whitespace-separated words in <VAR>text</VAR> that <EM>do</EM>
match the <VAR>pattern</VAR> words, returning only the words that <EM>do
not</EM> match.  This is the exact opposite of the <CODE>filter</CODE>
function.
For example, given:


<PRE>
objects=main1.o foo.o main2.o bar.o
mains=main1.o main2.o
</PRE>

the following generates a list which contains all the object files not
in <SAMP>`mains'</SAMP>:


<PRE>
$(filter-out $(mains),$(objects))
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX515"></A>
<A NAME="IDX516"></A>
<DT><CODE>$(sort <VAR>list</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Sorts the words of <VAR>list</VAR> in lexical order, removing duplicate
words.  The output is a list of words separated by single spaces.
Thus,


<PRE>
$(sort foo bar lose)
</PRE>

returns the value <SAMP>`bar foo lose'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX517"></A>
<A NAME="IDX518"></A>
<A NAME="IDX519"></A>
Incidentally, since <CODE>sort</CODE> removes duplicate words, you can use
it for this purpose even if you don't care about the sort order.
</DL>

<P>
Here is a realistic example of the use of <CODE>subst</CODE> and
<CODE>patsubst</CODE>.  Suppose that a makefile uses the <CODE>VPATH</CODE> variable
to specify a list of directories that <CODE>make</CODE> should search for
prerequisite files
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC27"><CODE>VPATH</CODE>: Search Path for All Prerequisites</A>).
This example shows how to
tell the C compiler to search for header files in the same list of
directories.
</P>
<P>
The value of <CODE>VPATH</CODE> is a list of directories separated by colons,
such as <SAMP>`src:../headers'</SAMP>.  First, the <CODE>subst</CODE> function is used to
change the colons to spaces:

</P>

<PRE>
$(subst :, ,$(VPATH))
</PRE>

<P>
This produces <SAMP>`src ../headers'</SAMP>.  Then <CODE>patsubst</CODE> is used to turn
each directory name into a <SAMP>`-I'</SAMP> flag.  These can be added to the
value of the variable <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>, which is passed automatically to the C
compiler, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
override CFLAGS += $(patsubst %,-I%,$(subst :, ,$(VPATH)))
</PRE>

<P>
The effect is to append the text <SAMP>`-Isrc -I../headers'</SAMP> to the
previously given value of <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>.  The <CODE>override</CODE> directive is
used so that the new value is assigned even if the previous value of
<CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> was specified with a command argument (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC66">The <CODE>override</CODE> Directive</A>).

Several of the built-in expansion functions relate specifically to
taking apart file names or lists of file names.

</P>
<P>
Each of the following functions performs a specific transformation on a
file name.  The argument of the function is regarded as a series of file
names, separated by whitespace.  (Leading and trailing whitespace is
ignored.)  Each file name in the series is transformed in the same way and
the results are concatenated with single spaces between them.

<DT><CODE>$(dir <VAR>names</VAR>...)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX522"></A>
<A NAME="IDX523"></A>
<A NAME="IDX524"></A>
Extracts the directory-part of each file name in <VAR>names</VAR>.  The
directory-part of the file name is everything up through (and
including) the last slash in it.  If the file name contains no slash,
the directory part is the string <SAMP>`./'</SAMP>.  For example,


<PRE>
$(dir src/foo.c hacks)
</PRE>

produces the result <SAMP>`src/ ./'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>$(notdir <VAR>names</VAR>...)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX525"></A>
<A NAME="IDX526"></A>
<A NAME="IDX527"></A>
Extracts all but the directory-part of each file name in <VAR>names</VAR>.
If the file name contains no slash, it is left unchanged.  Otherwise,
everything through the last slash is removed from it.

A file name that ends with a slash becomes an empty string.  This is
unfortunate, because it means that the result does not always have the
same number of whitespace-separated file names as the argument had;
but we do not see any other valid alternative.

For example,


<PRE>
$(notdir src/foo.c hacks)
</PRE>

produces the result <SAMP>`foo.c hacks'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>$(suffix <VAR>names</VAR>...)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX528"></A>
<A NAME="IDX529"></A>
<A NAME="IDX530"></A>
Extracts the suffix of each file name in <VAR>names</VAR>.  If the file name
contains a period, the suffix is everything starting with the last
period.  Otherwise, the suffix is the empty string.  This frequently
means that the result will be empty when <VAR>names</VAR> is not, and if
<VAR>names</VAR> contains multiple file names, the result may contain fewer
file names.

For example,


<PRE>
$(suffix src/foo.c src-1.0/bar.c hacks)
</PRE>

produces the result <SAMP>`.c .c'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>$(basename <VAR>names</VAR>...)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX531"></A>
<A NAME="IDX532"></A>
<A NAME="IDX533"></A>
Extracts all but the suffix of each file name in <VAR>names</VAR>.  If the
file name contains a period, the basename is everything starting up to
(and not including) the last period.  Periods in the directory part are
ignored.  If there is no period, the basename is the entire file name.
For example,


<PRE>
$(basename src/foo.c src-1.0/bar hacks)
</PRE>

produces the result <SAMP>`src/foo src-1.0/bar hacks'</SAMP>.

<DD>
<A NAME="IDX534"></A>
<A NAME="IDX535"></A>
<A NAME="IDX536"></A>
The argument <VAR>names</VAR> is regarded as a series of names, separated
by whitespace; <VAR>suffix</VAR> is used as a unit.  The value of
<VAR>suffix</VAR> is appended to the end of each individual name and the
resulting larger names are concatenated with single spaces between
them.  For example,


<PRE>
$(addsuffix .c,foo bar)
</PRE>

produces the result <SAMP>`foo.c bar.c'</SAMP>.

The argument <VAR>names</VAR> is regarded as a series of names, separated
by whitespace; <VAR>prefix</VAR> is used as a unit.  The value of
<VAR>prefix</VAR> is prepended to the front of each individual name and the
resulting larger names are concatenated with single spaces between
them.  For example,


<PRE>
$(addprefix src/,foo bar)
</PRE>

produces the result <SAMP>`src/foo src/bar'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>$(join <VAR>list1</VAR>,<VAR>list2</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX540"></A>
<A NAME="IDX541"></A>
<A NAME="IDX542"></A>
Concatenates the two arguments word by word: the two first words (one
from each argument) concatenated form the first word of the result, the
two second words form the second word of the result, and so on.  So the
<VAR>n</VAR>th word of the result comes from the <VAR>n</VAR>th word of each
argument.  If one argument has more words that the other, the extra
words are copied unchanged into the result.

For example, <SAMP>`$(join a b,.c .o)'</SAMP> produces <SAMP>`a.c b.o'</SAMP>.

Whitespace between the words in the lists is not preserved; it is
replaced with a single space.

This function can merge the results of the <CODE>dir</CODE> and
<CODE>notdir</CODE> functions, to produce the original list of files which
was given to those two functions.

<DD>
<A NAME="IDX543"></A>
<A NAME="IDX544"></A>
<A NAME="IDX545"></A>
Returns the <VAR>n</VAR>th word of <VAR>text</VAR>.  The legitimate values of
<VAR>n</VAR> start from 1.  If <VAR>n</VAR> is bigger than the number of words
in <VAR>text</VAR>, the value is empty.  For example,


<PRE>
$(word 2, foo bar baz)

returns <SAMP>`bar'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>$(wordlist <VAR>s</VAR>,<VAR>e</VAR>,<VAR>text</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX546"></A>
<A NAME="IDX547"></A>
<A NAME="IDX548"></A>
Returns the list of words in <VAR>text</VAR> starting with word <VAR>s</VAR> and
ending with word <VAR>e</VAR> (inclusive).  The legitimate values of <VAR>s</VAR>
and <VAR>e</VAR> start from 1.  If <VAR>s</VAR> is bigger than the number of words
in <VAR>text</VAR>, the value is empty.  If <VAR>e</VAR> is bigger than the number
of words in <VAR>text</VAR>, words up to the end of <VAR>text</VAR> are returned.
If <VAR>s</VAR> is greater than <VAR>e</VAR>, nothing is returned.  For example,


<PRE>
$(wordlist 2, 3, foo bar baz)
</PRE>

returns <SAMP>`bar baz'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>$(words <VAR>text</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX549"></A>
<A NAME="IDX550"></A>
Returns the number of words in <VAR>text</VAR>.
Thus, the last word of <VAR>text</VAR> is
<CODE>$(word $(words <VAR>text</VAR>),<VAR>text</VAR>)</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>$(firstword <VAR>names</VAR>...)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX551"></A>
<A NAME="IDX552"></A>
The argument <VAR>names</VAR> is regarded as a series of names, separated

of the names are ignored.

For example,


<PRE>
$(firstword foo bar)
</PRE>

produces the result <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP>.  Although <CODE>$(firstword
<VAR>text</VAR>)</CODE> is the same as <CODE>$(word 1,<VAR>text</VAR>)</CODE>, the

The argument <VAR>pattern</VAR> is a file name pattern, typically containing
wildcard characters (as in shell file name patterns).  The result of
<CODE>wildcard</CODE> is a space-separated list of the names of existing files
that match the pattern.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC22">Using Wildcard Characters in File Names</A>.

<H2><A NAME="SEC79" HREF="make.html#TOC79">The <CODE>foreach</CODE> Function</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX555"></A>
<A NAME="IDX556"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>foreach</CODE> function is very different from other functions.  It
causes one piece of text to be used repeatedly, each time with a different
substitution performed on it.  It resembles the <CODE>for</CODE> command in the
shell <CODE>sh</CODE> and the <CODE>foreach</CODE> command in the C-shell <CODE>csh</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The syntax of the <CODE>foreach</CODE> function is:

</P>

<PRE>
$(foreach <VAR>var</VAR>,<VAR>list</VAR>,<VAR>text</VAR>)
</PRE>

<P>
The first two arguments, <VAR>var</VAR> and <VAR>list</VAR>, are expanded before
anything else is done; note that the last argument, <VAR>text</VAR>, is
<STRONG>not</STRONG> expanded at the same time.  Then for each word of the expanded
value of <VAR>list</VAR>, the variable named by the expanded value of <VAR>var</VAR>
is set to that word, and <VAR>text</VAR> is expanded.  Presumably <VAR>text</VAR>
contains references to that variable, so its expansion will be different
each time.

</P>
<P>
The result is that <VAR>text</VAR> is expanded as many times as there are
whitespace-separated words in <VAR>list</VAR>.  The multiple expansions of
<VAR>text</VAR> are concatenated, with spaces between them, to make the result
of <CODE>foreach</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
This simple example sets the variable <SAMP>`files'</SAMP> to the list of all files
in the directories in the list <SAMP>`dirs'</SAMP>:

</P>

<PRE>
dirs := a b c d
files := $(foreach dir,$(dirs),$(wildcard $(dir)/*))
</PRE>

<P>
Here <VAR>text</VAR> is <SAMP>`$(wildcard $(dir)/*)'</SAMP>.  The first repetition
finds the value <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> for <CODE>dir</CODE>, so it produces the same result
as <SAMP>`$(wildcard a/*)'</SAMP>; the second repetition produces the result
of <SAMP>`$(wildcard b/*)'</SAMP>; and the third, that of <SAMP>`$(wildcard c/*)'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
This example has the same result (except for setting <SAMP>`dirs'</SAMP>) as
the following example:

</P>

<PRE>
files := $(wildcard a/* b/* c/* d/*)
</PRE>

<P>
When <VAR>text</VAR> is complicated, you can improve readability by giving it
a name, with an additional variable:

</P>

<PRE>
find_files = $(wildcard $(dir)/*)
dirs := a b c d
files := $(foreach dir,$(dirs),$(find_files))
</PRE>

<P>
Here we use the variable <CODE>find_files</CODE> this way.  We use plain <SAMP>`='</SAMP>
to define a recursively-expanding variable, so that its value contains an
actual function call to be reexpanded under the control of <CODE>foreach</CODE>;
a simply-expanded variable would not do, since <CODE>wildcard</CODE> would be
called only once at the time of defining <CODE>find_files</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>foreach</CODE> function has no permanent effect on the variable
<VAR>var</VAR>; its value and flavor after the <CODE>foreach</CODE> function call are
the same as they were beforehand.  The other values which are taken from
<VAR>list</VAR> are in effect only temporarily, during the execution of
<CODE>foreach</CODE>.  The variable <VAR>var</VAR> is a simply-expanded variable
during the execution of <CODE>foreach</CODE>.  If <VAR>var</VAR> was undefined
before the <CODE>foreach</CODE> function call, it is undefined after the call.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC59">The Two Flavors of Variables</A>.
</P>
<P>
You must take care when using complex variable expressions that result in
variable names because many strange things are valid variable names, but
are probably not what you intended.  For example,

</P>

<PRE>
files := $(foreach Esta escrito en espanol!,b c ch,$(find_files))
</PRE>

<P>
might be useful if the value of <CODE>find_files</CODE> references the variable
whose name is <SAMP>`Esta escrito en espanol!'</SAMP> (es un nombre bastante largo,
no?), but it is more likely to be a mistake.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC80" HREF="make.html#TOC80">The <CODE>if</CODE> Function</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX557"></A>
<A NAME="IDX558"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>if</CODE> function provides support for conditional expansion in a
functional context (as opposed to the GNU <CODE>make</CODE> makefile
conditionals such as <CODE>ifeq</CODE> (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC73">Syntax of Conditionals</A>).

</P>
<P>
An <CODE>if</CODE> function call can contain either two or three arguments:

</P>

<PRE>
$(if <VAR>condition</VAR>,<VAR>then-part</VAR>[,<VAR>else-part</VAR>])
</PRE>

<P>
The first argument, <VAR>condition</VAR>, first has all preceding and
trailing whitespace stripped, then is expanded.  If it expands to any
non-empty string, then the condition is considered to be true.  If it
expands to an empty string, the condition is considered to be false.

</P>
<P>
If the condition is true then the second argument, <VAR>then-part</VAR>, is
evaluated and this is used as the result of the evaluation of the entire
<CODE>if</CODE> function.

</P>
<P>
If the condition is false then the third argument, <VAR>else-part</VAR>, is
evaluated and this is the result of the <CODE>if</CODE> function.  If there is
no third argument, the <CODE>if</CODE> function evaluates to nothing (the
empty string).

</P>
<P>
Note that only one of the <VAR>then-part</VAR> or the <VAR>else-part</VAR> will be
evaluated, never both.  Thus, either can contain side-effects (such as
<CODE>shell</CODE> function calls, etc.)

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC81" HREF="make.html#TOC81">The <CODE>call</CODE> Function</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX559"></A>
<A NAME="IDX560"></A>
<A NAME="IDX561"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>call</CODE> function is unique in that it can be used to create new
parameterized functions.  You can write a complex expression as the
value of a variable, then use <CODE>call</CODE> to expand it with different
values.

</P>
<P>
The syntax of the <CODE>call</CODE> function is:

</P>

<PRE>
$(call <VAR>variable</VAR>,<VAR>param</VAR>,<VAR>param</VAR>,...)
</PRE>

<P>
When <CODE>make</CODE> expands this function, it assigns each <VAR>param</VAR> to
temporary variables <CODE>$(1)</CODE>, <CODE>$(2)</CODE>, etc.  The variable
<CODE>$(0)</CODE> will contain <VAR>variable</VAR>.  There is no maximum number of
parameter arguments.  There is no minimum, either, but it doesn't make
sense to use <CODE>call</CODE> with no parameters.

</P>
<P>
Then <VAR>variable</VAR> is expanded as a <CODE>make</CODE> variable in the context
of these temporary assignments.  Thus, any reference to <CODE>$(1)</CODE> in
the value of <VAR>variable</VAR> will resolve to the first <VAR>param</VAR> in the
invocation of <CODE>call</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Note that <VAR>variable</VAR> is the <EM>name</EM> of a variable, not a
<EM>reference</EM> to that variable.  Therefore you would not normally use
a <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> or parentheses when writing it.  (You can, however, use a
variable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a
constant.)

</P>
<P>
If <VAR>variable</VAR> is the name of a builtin function, the builtin function
is always invoked (even if a <CODE>make</CODE> variable by that name also
exists).

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>call</CODE> function expands the <VAR>param</VAR> arguments before
assigning them to temporary variables.  This means that <VAR>variable</VAR>
values containing references to builtin functions that have special
expansion rules, like <CODE>foreach</CODE> or <CODE>if</CODE>, may not work as you
expect.

</P>
<P>
Some examples may make this clearer.

</P>
<P>
This macro simply reverses its arguments:

</P>

<PRE>
reverse = $(2) $(1)

foo = $(call reverse,a,b)
</PRE>

<P>
Here <VAR>foo</VAR> will contain <SAMP>`b a'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
This one is slightly more interesting: it defines a macro to search for
the first instance of a program in <CODE>PATH</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
pathsearch = $(firstword $(wildcard $(addsufix /$(1),$(subst :, ,$(PATH)))))

LS := $(call pathsearch,ls)
</PRE>

<P>
Now the variable LS contains <CODE>/bin/ls</CODE> or similar.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>call</CODE> function can be nested.  Each recursive invocation gets
its own local values for <CODE>$(1)</CODE>, etc. that mask the values of
higher-level <CODE>call</CODE>.  For example, here is an implementation of a
<STRONG>map</STRONG> function:

</P>

<PRE>
map = $(foreach a,$(2),$(call $(1),$(a)))
</PRE>

<P>
Now you can <VAR>map</VAR> a function that normally takes only one argument,
such as <CODE>origin</CODE>, to multiple values in one step:

</P>

<PRE>
o = $(call map,origin,o map MAKE)
</PRE>

<P>
and end up with <VAR>o</VAR> containing something like <SAMP>`file file default'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
A final caution: be careful when adding whitespace to the arguments to
<CODE>call</CODE>.  As with other functions, any whitespace contained in the
second and subsequent arguments is kept; this can cause strange
effects.  It's generally safest to remove all extraneous whitespace when
providing parameters to <CODE>call</CODE>.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC82" HREF="make.html#TOC82">The <CODE>origin</CODE> Function</A></H2>

<A NAME="IDX562"></A>
<A NAME="IDX563"></A>
<A NAME="IDX564"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>origin</CODE> function is unlike most other functions in that it does
not operate on the values of variables; it tells you something <EM>about</EM>
a variable.  Specifically, it tells you where it came from.

</P>
<P>
The syntax of the <CODE>origin</CODE> function is:

</P>

<PRE>
$(origin <VAR>variable</VAR>)
</PRE>

<P>
Note that <VAR>variable</VAR> is the <EM>name</EM> of a variable to inquire about;
not a <EM>reference</EM> to that variable.  Therefore you would not normally
use a <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> or parentheses when writing it.  (You can, however, use a
variable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a constant.)

</P>
<P>
The result of this function is a string telling you how the variable
<VAR>variable</VAR> was defined:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`undefined'</SAMP>
<DD>
if <VAR>variable</VAR> was never defined.

<DT><SAMP>`default'</SAMP>

if <VAR>variable</VAR> has a default definition, as is usual with <CODE>CC</CODE>
and so on.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC96">Variables Used by Implicit Rules</A>.
Note that if you have redefined a default variable, the <CODE>origin</CODE>
function will return the origin of the later definition.

</DL>

<P>
This information is primarily useful (other than for your curiosity) to
determine if you want to believe the value of a variable.  For example,
suppose you have a makefile <TT>`foo'</TT> that includes another makefile
<TT>`bar'</TT>.  You want a variable <CODE>bletch</CODE> to be defined in <TT>`bar'</TT>
if you run the command <SAMP>`make -f bar'</SAMP>, even if the environment contains
a definition of <CODE>bletch</CODE>.  However, if <TT>`foo'</TT> defined
<CODE>bletch</CODE> before including <TT>`bar'</TT>, you do not want to override that
definition.  This could be done by using an <CODE>override</CODE> directive in
<TT>`foo'</TT>, giving that definition precedence over the later definition in
<TT>`bar'</TT>; unfortunately, the <CODE>override</CODE> directive would also
override any command line definitions.  So, <TT>`bar'</TT> could
include:
</P>

<PRE>
ifdef bletch
ifeq "$(origin bletch)" "environment"
bletch = barf, gag, etc.
endif
endif
</PRE>

<P>
If <CODE>bletch</CODE> has been defined from the environment, this will redefine
it.

</P>
<P>
If you want to override a previous definition of <CODE>bletch</CODE> if it came
from the environment, even under <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP>, you could instead write:

</P>

<PRE>
ifneq "$(findstring environment,$(origin bletch))" ""
bletch = barf, gag, etc.
endif
</PRE>

<P>
Here the redefinition takes place if <SAMP>`$(origin bletch)'</SAMP> returns either
<SAMP>`environment'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`environment override'</SAMP>.

<P>
The <CODE>shell</CODE> function is unlike any other function except the
<CODE>wildcard</CODE> function
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC25">The Function <CODE>wildcard</CODE></A>) in that it
communicates with the world outside of <CODE>make</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>shell</CODE> function performs the same function that backquotes
(<SAMP>``'</SAMP>) perform in most shells: it does <STRONG>command expansion</STRONG>.  This
means that it takes an argument that is a shell command and returns the
output of the command.  The only processing <CODE>make</CODE> does on the result,
before substituting it into the surrounding text, is to convert each
newline or carriage-return / newline pair to a single space.  It also
removes the trailing (carriage-return and) newline, if it's the last
thing in the result.
</P>
<P>
The commands run by calls to the <CODE>shell</CODE> function are run when the
function calls are expanded.  In most cases, this is when the makefile is
read in.  The exception is that function calls in the commands of the rules
are expanded when the commands are run, and this applies to <CODE>shell</CODE>
function calls like all others.

</P>
<P>
Here are some examples of the use of the <CODE>shell</CODE> function:

</P>

<PRE>
contents := $(shell cat foo)
</PRE>

<P>
sets <CODE>contents</CODE> to the contents of the file <TT>`foo'</TT>, with a space
(rather than a newline) separating each line.

</P>

<PRE>
files := $(shell echo *.c)
</PRE>

<P>
sets <CODE>files</CODE> to the expansion of <SAMP>`*.c'</SAMP>.  Unless <CODE>make</CODE> is
using a very strange shell, this has the same result as
<SAMP>`$(wildcard *.c)'</SAMP>.

These functions control the way make runs.  Generally, they are used to
provide information to the user of the makefile or to cause make to stop
if some sort of environmental error is detected.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>$(error <VAR>text</VAR>...)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX571"></A>
<A NAME="IDX572"></A>
<A NAME="IDX573"></A>
Generates a fatal error where the message is <VAR>text</VAR>.  Note that the
error is generated whenever this function is evaluated.  So, if you put
it inside a command script or on the right side of a recursive variable
assignment, it won't be evaluated until later.  The <VAR>text</VAR> will be
expanded before the error is generated.

For example,


<PRE>
ifdef ERROR1
$(error error is $(ERROR1))
endif
</PRE>

will generate a fatal error during the read of the makefile if the
<CODE>make</CODE> variable <CODE>ERROR1</CODE> is defined.  Or,


<PRE>
ERR = $(error found an error!)

.PHONY: err
err: ; $(ERR)
</PRE>

will generate a fatal error while <CODE>make</CODE> is running, if the
<CODE>err</CODE> target is invoked.

<DT><CODE>$(warning <VAR>text</VAR>...)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX574"></A>
<A NAME="IDX575"></A>
<A NAME="IDX576"></A>
This function works similarly to the <CODE>error</CODE> function, above,
except that <CODE>make</CODE> doesn't exit.  Instead, <VAR>text</VAR> is expanded
and the resulting message is displayed, but processing of the makefile
continues.

The result of the expansion of this function is the empty string.

<H1><A NAME="SEC85" HREF="make.html#TOC85">How to Run <CODE>make</CODE></A></H1>

<P>
A makefile that says how to recompile a program can be used in more
than one way.  The simplest use is to recompile every file that is out
of date.  Usually, makefiles are written so that if you run
<CODE>make</CODE> with no arguments, it does just that.

</P>
<P>
But you might want to update only some of the files; you might want to use
a different compiler or different compiler options; you might want just to
find out which files are out of date without changing them.

</P>
<P>
By giving arguments when you run <CODE>make</CODE>, you can do any of these
things and many others.

</P>
<P>
The exit status of <CODE>make</CODE> is always one of three values:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>0</CODE>
<DD>
The exit status is zero if <CODE>make</CODE> is successful.
<DT><CODE>2</CODE>
<DD>
The exit status is two if <CODE>make</CODE> encounters any errors.
It will print messages describing the particular errors.
<DT><CODE>1</CODE>
<DD>
The exit status is one if you use the <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP> flag and <CODE>make</CODE>
determines that some target is not already up to date.

<H2><A NAME="SEC86" HREF="make.html#TOC86">Arguments to Specify the Makefile</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX577"></A>
<A NAME="IDX578"></A>
<A NAME="IDX579"></A>

</P>
<P>
The way to specify the name of the makefile is with the <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--file'</SAMP> option (<SAMP>`--makefile'</SAMP> also works).  For example,
<SAMP>`-f altmake'</SAMP> says to use the file <TT>`altmake'</TT> as the makefile.

</P>
<P>
If you use the <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> flag several times and follow each <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP>
with an argument, all the specified files are used jointly as
makefiles.

</P>
<P>
If you do not use the <SAMP>`-f'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--file'</SAMP> flag, the default is
to try <TT>`GNUmakefile'</TT>, <TT>`makefile'</TT>, and <TT>`Makefile'</TT>, in
that order, and use the first of these three which exists or can be made
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC12">Writing Makefiles</A>).
</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC87" HREF="make.html#TOC87">Arguments to Specify the Goals</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX580"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <STRONG>goals</STRONG> are the targets that <CODE>make</CODE> should strive ultimately
to update.  Other targets are updated as well if they appear as
prerequisites of goals, or prerequisites of prerequisites of goals, etc.

</P>
<P>
By default, the goal is the first target in the makefile (not counting
targets that start with a period).  Therefore, makefiles are usually
written so that the first target is for compiling the entire program or
programs they describe.  If the first rule in the makefile has several
targets, only the first target in the rule becomes the default goal, not
the whole list.

</P>
<P>
You can specify a different goal or goals with arguments to <CODE>make</CODE>.
Use the name of the goal as an argument.  If you specify several goals,
<CODE>make</CODE> processes each of them in turn, in the order you name them.

</P>
<P>
Any target in the makefile may be specified as a goal (unless it
starts with <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> or contains an <SAMP>`='</SAMP>, in which case it will be
parsed as a switch or variable definition, respectively).  Even
targets not in the makefile may be specified, if <CODE>make</CODE> can find
implicit rules that say how to make them.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX581"></A>
<A NAME="IDX582"></A>
<CODE>Make</CODE> will set the special variable <CODE>MAKECMDGOALS</CODE> to the
list of goals you specified on the command line.  If no goals were given
on the command line, this variable is empty.  Note that this variable
should be used only in special circumstances.

</P>
<P>
An example of appropriate use is to avoid including <TT>`.d'</TT> files
during <CODE>clean</CODE> rules (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC43">Generating Prerequisites Automatically</A>), so
<CODE>make</CODE> won't create them only to immediately remove them
again:
</P>

<PRE>
sources = foo.c bar.c

ifneq ($(MAKECMDGOALS),clean)
include $(sources:.c=.d)
endif
</PRE>

<P>
One use of specifying a goal is if you want to compile only a part of
the program, or only one of several programs.  Specify as a goal each
file that you wish to remake.  For example, consider a directory containing
several programs, with a makefile that starts like this:

</P>

<PRE>
.PHONY: all
all: size nm ld ar as
</PRE>

<P>
If you are working on the program <CODE>size</CODE>, you might want to say
<SAMP>`make size'</SAMP> so that only the files of that program are recompiled.

</P>
<P>
Another use of specifying a goal is to make files that are not normally
made.  For example, there may be a file of debugging output, or a
version of the program that is compiled specially for testing, which has
a rule in the makefile but is not a prerequisite of the default goal.

</P>
<P>
Another use of specifying a goal is to run the commands associated with
a phony target (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC33">Phony Targets</A>) or empty target (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC35">Empty Target Files to Record Events</A>).  Many makefiles contain
a phony target named <TT>`clean'</TT> which deletes everything except source
files.  Naturally, this is done only if you request it explicitly with
<SAMP>`make clean'</SAMP>.  Following is a list of typical phony and empty
target names.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC121">Standard Targets for Users</A>, for a detailed list of all the
standard target names which GNU software packages use.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><TT>`all'</TT>

With the <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> flag, <CODE>make</CODE> ignores the commands in the rules

be remade.  The <CODE>touch</CODE> command is also printed, unless <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> or

<P>
Sometimes you may have changed a source file but you do not want to
recompile all the files that depend on it.  For example, suppose you add
a macro or a declaration to a header file that many other files depend
on.  Being conservative, <CODE>make</CODE> assumes that any change in the
header file requires recompilation of all dependent files, but you know
that they do not need to be recompiled and you would rather not waste
the time waiting for them to compile.

</P>
<P>
If you anticipate the problem before changing the header file, you can
use the <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> flag.  This flag tells <CODE>make</CODE> not to run the
commands in the rules, but rather to mark the target up to date by
changing its last-modification date.  You would follow this procedure:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Use the command <SAMP>`make'</SAMP> to recompile the source files that really
need recompilation.

<LI>

Make the changes in the header files.

<LI>

Use the command <SAMP>`make -t'</SAMP> to mark all the object files as
up to date.  The next time you run <CODE>make</CODE>, the changes in the
header files will not cause any recompilation.
</OL>

<P>
If you have already changed the header file at a time when some files
do need recompilation, it is too late to do this.  Instead, you can
use the <SAMP>`-o <VAR>file</VAR>'</SAMP> flag, which marks a specified file as
"old" (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC92">Summary of Options</A>).  This means
that the file itself will not be remade, and nothing else will be
remade on its account.  Follow this procedure:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Recompile the source files that need compilation for reasons independent
of the particular header file, with <SAMP>`make -o <VAR>headerfile</VAR>'</SAMP>.
If several header files are involved, use a separate <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> option
for each header file.

<LI>

Touch all the object files with <SAMP>`make -t'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX624"></A>
<A NAME="IDX625"></A>

</P>
<P>
An argument that contains <SAMP>`='</SAMP> specifies the value of a variable:
<SAMP>`<VAR>v</VAR>=<VAR>x</VAR>'</SAMP> sets the value of the variable <VAR>v</VAR> to <VAR>x</VAR>.
If you specify a value in this way, all ordinary assignments of the same
variable in the makefile are ignored; we say they have been
<STRONG>overridden</STRONG> by the command line argument.

</P>
<P>
The most common way to use this facility is to pass extra flags to
compilers.  For example, in a properly written makefile, the variable
<CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> is included in each command that runs the C compiler, so a
file <TT>`foo.c'</TT> would be compiled something like this:

</P>

<PRE>
cc -c $(CFLAGS) foo.c
</PRE>

<P>
Thus, whatever value you set for <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> affects each compilation
that occurs.  The makefile probably specifies the usual value for
<CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
CFLAGS=-g
</PRE>

<P>
Each time you run <CODE>make</CODE>, you can override this value if you
wish.  For example, if you say <SAMP>`make CFLAGS='-g -O''</SAMP>, each C
compilation will be done with <SAMP>`cc -c -g -O'</SAMP>.  (This illustrates
how you can use quoting in the shell to enclose spaces and other
special characters in the value of a variable when you override it.)

</P>
<P>
The variable <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> is only one of many standard variables that
exist just so that you can change them this way.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC96">Variables Used by Implicit Rules</A>, for a complete list.

</P>
<P>
You can also program the makefile to look at additional variables of your
own, giving the user the ability to control other aspects of how the
makefile works by changing the variables.

</P>
<P>
When you override a variable with a command argument, you can define either
a recursively-expanded variable or a simply-expanded variable.  The
examples shown above make a recursively-expanded variable; to make a
simply-expanded variable, write <SAMP>`:='</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`='</SAMP>.  But, unless
you want to include a variable reference or function call in the
<EM>value</EM> that you specify, it makes no difference which kind of
variable you create.

</P>
<P>
There is one way that the makefile can change a variable that you have
overridden.  This is to use the <CODE>override</CODE> directive, which is a line
that looks like this: <SAMP>`override <VAR>variable</VAR> = <VAR>value</VAR>'</SAMP>
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC66">The <CODE>override</CODE> Directive</A>).

Normally, when an error happens in executing a shell command, <CODE>make</CODE>
gives up immediately, returning a nonzero status.  No further commands are
executed for any target.  The error implies that the goal cannot be
correctly remade, and <CODE>make</CODE> reports this as soon as it knows.

</P>
<P>
When you are compiling a program that you have just changed, this is not
what you want.  Instead, you would rather that <CODE>make</CODE> try compiling
every file that can be tried, to show you as many compilation errors
as possible.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX628"></A>
<A NAME="IDX629"></A>
On these occasions, you should use the <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--keep-going'</SAMP> flag.  This tells <CODE>make</CODE> to continue to
consider the other prerequisites of the pending targets, remaking them
if necessary, before it gives up and returns nonzero status.  For
example, after an error in compiling one object file, <SAMP>`make -k'</SAMP>
will continue compiling other object files even though it already
knows that linking them will be impossible.  In addition to continuing
after failed shell commands, <SAMP>`make -k'</SAMP> will continue as much as
possible after discovering that it does not know how to make a target
or prerequisite file.  This will always cause an error message, but
without <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP>, it is a fatal error (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC92">Summary of Options</A>).
</P>
<P>
The usual behavior of <CODE>make</CODE> assumes that your purpose is to get the
goals up to date; once <CODE>make</CODE> learns that this is impossible, it might
as well report the failure immediately.  The <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> flag says that the
real purpose is to test as much as possible of the changes made in the
program, perhaps to find several independent problems so that you can
correct them all before the next attempt to compile.  This is why Emacs'
<KBD>M-x compile</KBD> command passes the <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> flag by default.

whether the build was successful or not.

<DT><CODE>v (<I>verbose</I>)</CODE>
<DD>
A level above <SAMP>`basic'</SAMP>; includes messages about which makefiles were
parsed, prerequisites that did not need to be rebuilt, etc.  This option
also enables <SAMP>`basic'</SAMP> messages.

By default, the above messages are not enabled while trying to remake
the makefiles.  This option enables messages while rebuilding makefiles,
too.  Note that the <SAMP>`all'</SAMP> option does enable this option.  This

<DD>
<A NAME="IDX672"></A>

Eliminate use of the built-in rule-specific variables (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC96">Variables Used by Implicit Rules</A>).  You can still define
your own, of course.  The <SAMP>`-R'</SAMP> option also automatically enables

<A NAME="IDX681"></A>

Touch files (mark them up to date without really changing them)
instead of running their commands.  This is used to pretend that the
commands were done, in order to fool future invocations of

<A NAME="IDX685"></A>
Print a message containing the working directory both before and after
executing the makefile.  This may be useful for tracking down errors
from complicated nests of recursive <CODE>make</CODE> commands.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC50">Recursive Use of <CODE>make</CODE></A>.  (In practice, you

<DT><SAMP>`--no-print-directory'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX686"></A>
Disable printing of the working directory under <CODE>-w</CODE>.
This option is useful when <CODE>-w</CODE> is turned on automatically,
but you do not want to see the extra messages.

Pretend that the target <VAR>file</VAR> has just been modified.  When used
with the <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP> flag, this shows you what would happen if you were
to modify that file.  Without <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP>, it is almost the same as
running a <CODE>touch</CODE> command on the given file before running
<CODE>make</CODE>, except that the modification time is changed only in the
imagination of <CODE>make</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Certain standard ways of remaking target files are used very often.  For
example, one customary way to make an object file is from a C source file
using the C compiler, <CODE>cc</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Implicit rules</STRONG> tell <CODE>make</CODE> how to use customary techniques so
that you do not have to specify them in detail when you want to use
them.  For example, there is an implicit rule for C compilation.  File
names determine which implicit rules are run.  For example, C
compilation typically takes a <TT>`.c'</TT> file and makes a <TT>`.o'</TT> file.
So <CODE>make</CODE> applies the implicit rule for C compilation when it sees
this combination of file name endings.
</P>
<P>
A chain of implicit rules can apply in sequence; for example, <CODE>make</CODE>
will remake a <TT>`.o'</TT> file from a <TT>`.y'</TT> file by way of a <TT>`.c'</TT> file.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC97">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>.

</P>
<P>
The built-in implicit rules use several variables in their commands so
that, by changing the values of the variables, you can change the way the
implicit rule works.  For example, the variable <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> controls the
flags given to the C compiler by the implicit rule for C compilation.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC96">Variables Used by Implicit Rules</A>.

</P>
<P>
You can define your own implicit rules by writing <STRONG>pattern rules</STRONG>.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC98">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</A>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Suffix rules</STRONG> are a more limited way to define implicit rules.
Pattern rules are more general and clearer, but suffix rules are
retained for compatibility.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC106">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</A>.

</P>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX696"></A>
<A NAME="IDX697"></A>

</P>
<P>
To allow <CODE>make</CODE> to find a customary method for updating a target file,
all you have to do is refrain from specifying commands yourself.  Either
write a rule with no command lines, or don't write a rule at all.  Then
<CODE>make</CODE> will figure out which implicit rule to use based on which
kind of source file exists or can be made.

</P>
<P>
For example, suppose the makefile looks like this:

</P>

<PRE>
foo : foo.o bar.o
        cc -o foo foo.o bar.o $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
</PRE>

<P>
Because you mention <TT>`foo.o'</TT> but do not give a rule for it, <CODE>make</CODE>
will automatically look for an implicit rule that tells how to update it.
This happens whether or not the file <TT>`foo.o'</TT> currently exists.

</P>
<P>
If an implicit rule is found, it can supply both commands and one or
more prerequisites (the source files).  You would want to write a rule
for <TT>`foo.o'</TT> with no command lines if you need to specify additional
prerequisites, such as header files, that the implicit rule cannot
supply.

</P>
<P>
Each implicit rule has a target pattern and prerequisite patterns.  There may
be many implicit rules with the same target pattern.  For example, numerous
rules make <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> files: one, from a <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> file with the C compiler;
another, from a <SAMP>`.p'</SAMP> file with the Pascal compiler; and so on.  The rule
that actually applies is the one whose prerequisites exist or can be made.
So, if you have a file <TT>`foo.c'</TT>, <CODE>make</CODE> will run the C compiler;
otherwise, if you have a file <TT>`foo.p'</TT>, <CODE>make</CODE> will run the Pascal
compiler; and so on.

</P>
<P>
Of course, when you write the makefile, you know which implicit rule you
want <CODE>make</CODE> to use, and you know it will choose that one because you
know which possible prerequisite files are supposed to exist.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC95">Catalogue of Implicit Rules</A>,
for a catalogue of all the predefined implicit rules.

</P>
<P>
Above, we said an implicit rule applies if the required prerequisites "exist
or can be made".  A file "can be made" if it is mentioned explicitly in
the makefile as a target or a prerequisite, or if an implicit rule can be
recursively found for how to make it.  When an implicit prerequisite is the
result of another implicit rule, we say that <STRONG>chaining</STRONG> is occurring.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC97">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>.

</P>
<P>
In general, <CODE>make</CODE> searches for an implicit rule for each target, and
for each double-colon rule, that has no commands.  A file that is mentioned
only as a prerequisite is considered a target whose rule specifies nothing,
so implicit rule search happens for it.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC107">Implicit Rule Search Algorithm</A>, for the
details of how the search is done.

</P>
<P>
Note that explicit prerequisites do not influence implicit rule search.
For example, consider this explicit rule:

</P>

<PRE>
foo.o: foo.p
</PRE>

<P>
The prerequisite on <TT>`foo.p'</TT> does not necessarily mean that
<CODE>make</CODE> will remake <TT>`foo.o'</TT> according to the implicit rule to
make an object file, a <TT>`.o'</TT> file, from a Pascal source file, a
<TT>`.p'</TT> file.  For example, if <TT>`foo.c'</TT> also exists, the implicit
rule to make an object file from a C source file is used instead,
because it appears before the Pascal rule in the list of predefined
implicit rules (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC95">Catalogue of Implicit Rules</A>).

</P>
<P>
If you do not want an implicit rule to be used for a target that has no
commands, you can give that target empty commands by writing a semicolon
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC56">Using Empty Commands</A>).

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC95" HREF="make.html#TOC95">Catalogue of Implicit Rules</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX698"></A>
<A NAME="IDX699"></A>

</P>
<P>
Here is a catalogue of predefined implicit rules which are always
available unless the makefile explicitly overrides or cancels them.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC104">Canceling Implicit Rules</A>, for information on
canceling or overriding an implicit rule.  The <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--no-builtin-rules'</SAMP> option cancels all predefined rules.

</P>
<P>
Not all of these rules will always be defined, even when the <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>
option is not given.  Many of the predefined implicit rules are
implemented in <CODE>make</CODE> as suffix rules, so which ones will be
defined depends on the <STRONG>suffix list</STRONG> (the list of prerequisites of
the special target <CODE>.SUFFIXES</CODE>).  The default suffix list is:
<CODE>.out</CODE>, <CODE>.a</CODE>, <CODE>.ln</CODE>, <CODE>.o</CODE>, <CODE>.c</CODE>, <CODE>.cc</CODE>,
<CODE>.C</CODE>, <CODE>.p</CODE>, <CODE>.f</CODE>, <CODE>.F</CODE>, <CODE>.r</CODE>, <CODE>.y</CODE>,
<CODE>.l</CODE>, <CODE>.s</CODE>, <CODE>.S</CODE>, <CODE>.mod</CODE>, <CODE>.sym</CODE>, <CODE>.def</CODE>,

<CODE>.texi</CODE>, <CODE>.txinfo</CODE>, <CODE>.w</CODE>, <CODE>.ch</CODE> <CODE>.web</CODE>,
<CODE>.sh</CODE>, <CODE>.elc</CODE>, <CODE>.el</CODE>.  All of the implicit rules
described below whose prerequisites have one of these suffixes are
actually suffix rules.  If you modify the suffix list, the only
predefined suffix rules in effect will be those named by one or two of
the suffixes that are on the list you specify; rules whose suffixes fail
to be on the list are disabled.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC106">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</A>, for full details on suffix rules.

This rule does the right thing for a simple program with only one
source file.  It will also do the right thing if there are multiple
object files (presumably coming from various other source files), one
of which has a name matching that of the executable file.  Thus,


<PRE>
x: y.o z.o
</PRE>

when <TT>`x.c'</TT>, <TT>`y.c'</TT> and <TT>`z.c'</TT> all exist will execute:


<PRE>
cc -c x.c -o x.o
cc -c y.c -o y.o
cc -c z.c -o z.o
cc x.o y.o z.o -o x
rm -f x.o
rm -f y.o
rm -f z.o
</PRE>

In more complicated cases, such as when there is no object file whose
name derives from the executable file name, you must write an explicit
command for linking.

Each kind of file automatically made into <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> object files will
be automatically linked by using the compiler (<SAMP>`$(CC)'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`$(FC)'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`$(PC)'</SAMP>; the C compiler <SAMP>`$(CC)'</SAMP> is used to
assemble <SAMP>`.s'</SAMP> files) without the <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP> option.  This could be
done by using the <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> object files as intermediates, but it is
faster to do the compiling and linking in one step, so that's how it's
done.

command used is <SAMP>`$(GET) $(GFLAGS)'</SAMP>.  The rules for SCCS are
terminal (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC103">Match-Anything Pattern Rules</A>),
so SCCS files cannot be generated from another source; they must
actually exist.
<A NAME="IDX765"></A>
For the benefit of SCCS, a file <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>'</TT> is copied from
<TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.sh'</TT> and made executable (by everyone).  This is for
shell scripts that are checked into SCCS.  Since RCS preserves the
execution permission of a file, you do not need to use this feature
with RCS.
We recommend that you avoid using of SCCS.  RCS is widely held to be
superior, and is also free.  By choosing free software in place of
comparable (or inferior) proprietary software, you support the free
software movement.
</DL>

<P>
Usually, you want to change only the variables listed in the table
above, which are documented in the following section.

</P>
<P>
However, the commands in built-in implicit rules actually use
variables such as <CODE>COMPILE.c</CODE>, <CODE>LINK.p</CODE>, and
<CODE>PREPROCESS.S</CODE>, whose values contain the commands listed above.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>make</CODE> follows the convention that the rule to compile a
<TT>`.<VAR>x</VAR>'</TT> source file uses the variable <CODE>COMPILE.<VAR>x</VAR></CODE>.
Similarly, the rule to produce an executable from a <TT>`.<VAR>x</VAR>'</TT>
file uses <CODE>LINK.<VAR>x</VAR></CODE>; and the rule to preprocess a
<TT>`.<VAR>x</VAR>'</TT> file uses <CODE>PREPROCESS.<VAR>x</VAR></CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX766"></A>
Every rule that produces an object file uses the variable
<CODE>OUTPUT_OPTION</CODE>.  <CODE>make</CODE> defines this variable either to
contain <SAMP>`-o $@'</SAMP>, or to be empty, depending on a compile-time
option.  You need the <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> option to ensure that the output goes
into the right file when the source file is in a different directory,
as when using <CODE>VPATH</CODE> (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC26">Searching Directories for Prerequisites</A>).  However,
compilers on some systems do not accept a <SAMP>`-o'</SAMP> switch for object
files.  If you use such a system, and use <CODE>VPATH</CODE>, some
compilations will put their output in the wrong place.
A possible workaround for this problem is to give <CODE>OUTPUT_OPTION</CODE>
the value <SAMP>`; mv $*.o $@'</SAMP>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC96" HREF="make.html#TOC96">Variables Used by Implicit Rules</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX767"></A>

</P>
<P>
The commands in built-in implicit rules make liberal use of certain
predefined variables.  You can alter these variables in the makefile,
with arguments to <CODE>make</CODE>, or in the environment to alter how the
implicit rules work without redefining the rules themselves.  You can
cancel all variables used by implicit rules with the <SAMP>`-R'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`--no-builtin-variables'</SAMP> option.

</P>
<P>
For example, the command used to compile a C source file actually says
<SAMP>`$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS)'</SAMP>.  The default values of the variables
used are <SAMP>`cc'</SAMP> and nothing, resulting in the command <SAMP>`cc -c'</SAMP>.  By
redefining <SAMP>`CC'</SAMP> to <SAMP>`ncc'</SAMP>, you could cause <SAMP>`ncc'</SAMP> to be
used for all C compilations performed by the implicit rule.  By redefining
<SAMP>`CFLAGS'</SAMP> to be <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP>, you could pass the <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> option to
each compilation.  <EM>All</EM> implicit rules that do C compilation use
<SAMP>`$(CC)'</SAMP> to get the program name for the compiler and <EM>all</EM>
include <SAMP>`$(CFLAGS)'</SAMP> among the arguments given to the compiler.
</P>
<P>
The variables used in implicit rules fall into two classes: those that are
names of programs (like <CODE>CC</CODE>) and those that contain arguments for the
programs (like <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>).  (The "name of a program" may also contain
some command arguments, but it must start with an actual executable program
name.)  If a variable value contains more than one argument, separate them
with spaces.

<H2><A NAME="SEC97" HREF="make.html#TOC97">Chains of Implicit Rules</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX819"></A>
<A NAME="IDX820"></A>
Sometimes a file can be made by a sequence of implicit rules.  For example,
a file <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.o'</TT> could be made from <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.y'</TT> by running
first Yacc and then <CODE>cc</CODE>.  Such a sequence is called a <STRONG>chain</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
If the file <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.c'</TT> exists, or is mentioned in the makefile, no
special searching is required: <CODE>make</CODE> finds that the object file can
be made by C compilation from <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.c'</TT>; later on, when considering
how to make <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.c'</TT>, the rule for running Yacc is
used.  Ultimately both <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.c'</TT> and <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.o'</TT> are
updated.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX821"></A>
<A NAME="IDX822"></A>
However, even if <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.c'</TT> does not exist and is not mentioned,
<CODE>make</CODE> knows how to envision it as the missing link between
<TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.o'</TT> and <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.y'</TT>!  In this case, <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.c'</TT> is
called an <STRONG>intermediate file</STRONG>.  Once <CODE>make</CODE> has decided to use the
intermediate file, it is entered in the data base as if it had been
mentioned in the makefile, along with the implicit rule that says how to
create it.
</P>
<P>
Intermediate files are remade using their rules just like all other
files.  But intermediate files are treated differently in two ways.

</P>
<P>
The first difference is what happens if the intermediate file does not
exist.  If an ordinary file <VAR>b</VAR> does not exist, and <CODE>make</CODE>
considers a target that depends on <VAR>b</VAR>, it invariably creates
<VAR>b</VAR> and then updates the target from <VAR>b</VAR>.  But if <VAR>b</VAR> is an
intermediate file, then <CODE>make</CODE> can leave well enough alone.  It
won't bother updating <VAR>b</VAR>, or the ultimate target, unless some
prerequisite of <VAR>b</VAR> is newer than that target or there is some other
reason to update that target.

</P>
<P>
The second difference is that if <CODE>make</CODE> <EM>does</EM> create <VAR>b</VAR>
in order to update something else, it deletes <VAR>b</VAR> later on after it
is no longer needed.  Therefore, an intermediate file which did not
exist before <CODE>make</CODE> also does not exist after <CODE>make</CODE>.
<CODE>make</CODE> reports the deletion to you by printing a <SAMP>`rm -f'</SAMP>
command showing which file it is deleting.

</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, a file cannot be intermediate if it is mentioned in the
makefile as a target or prerequisite.  However, you can explicitly mark a
file as intermediate by listing it as a prerequisite of the special target
<CODE>.INTERMEDIATE</CODE>.  This takes effect even if the file is mentioned
explicitly in some other way.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX823"></A>
<A NAME="IDX824"></A>
<A NAME="IDX825"></A>
You can prevent automatic deletion of an intermediate file by marking it
as a <STRONG>secondary</STRONG> file.  To do this, list it as a prerequisite of the
special target <CODE>.SECONDARY</CODE>.  When a file is secondary, <CODE>make</CODE>
will not create the file merely because it does not already exist, but
<CODE>make</CODE> does not automatically delete the file.  Marking a file as
secondary also marks it as intermediate.

</P>
<P>
You can list the target pattern of an implicit rule (such as <SAMP>`%.o'</SAMP>)
as a prerequisite of the special target <CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE> to preserve
intermediate files made by implicit rules whose target patterns match
that file's name; see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC49">Interrupting or Killing <CODE>make</CODE></A>.<A NAME="IDX826"></A>
<A NAME="IDX827"></A>

</P>
<P>
A chain can involve more than two implicit rules.  For example, it is
possible to make a file <TT>`foo'</TT> from <TT>`RCS/foo.y,v'</TT> by running RCS,
Yacc and <CODE>cc</CODE>.  Then both <TT>`foo.y'</TT> and <TT>`foo.c'</TT> are
intermediate files that are deleted at the end.
</P>
<P>
No single implicit rule can appear more than once in a chain.  This means
that <CODE>make</CODE> will not even consider such a ridiculous thing as making
<TT>`foo'</TT> from <TT>`foo.o.o'</TT> by running the linker twice.  This
constraint has the added benefit of preventing any infinite loop in the
search for an implicit rule chain.

</P>
<P>
There are some special implicit rules to optimize certain cases that would
otherwise be handled by rule chains.  For example, making <TT>`foo'</TT> from
<TT>`foo.c'</TT> could be handled by compiling and linking with separate
chained rules, using <TT>`foo.o'</TT> as an intermediate file.  But what
actually happens is that a special rule for this case does the compilation
and linking with a single <CODE>cc</CODE> command.  The optimized rule is used in
preference to the step-by-step chain because it comes earlier in the
ordering of rules.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC98" HREF="make.html#TOC98">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</A></H2>

<P>
You define an implicit rule by writing a <STRONG>pattern rule</STRONG>.  A pattern
rule looks like an ordinary rule, except that its target contains the
character <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> (exactly one of them).  The target is considered a
pattern for matching file names; the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> can match any nonempty
substring, while other characters match only themselves.  The prerequisites
likewise use <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> to show how their names relate to the target name.

</P>
<P>
Thus, a pattern rule <SAMP>`%.o : %.c'</SAMP> says how to make any file
<TT>`<VAR>stem</VAR>.o'</TT> from another file <TT>`<VAR>stem</VAR>.c'</TT>.
</P>
<P>
Note that expansion using <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> in pattern rules occurs
<STRONG>after</STRONG> any variable or function expansions, which take place
when the makefile is read.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC57">How to Use Variables</A>, and section <A HREF="make.html#SEC75">Functions for Transforming Text</A>.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC99" HREF="make.html#TOC99">Introduction to Pattern Rules</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX828"></A>
<A NAME="IDX829"></A>

</P>
<P>
A pattern rule contains the character <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> (exactly one of them)
in the target; otherwise, it looks exactly like an ordinary rule.  The
target is a pattern for matching file names; the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> matches any
nonempty substring, while other characters match only themselves.
<A NAME="IDX830"></A>
<A NAME="IDX831"></A>

</P>
<P>
For example, <SAMP>`%.c'</SAMP> as a pattern matches any file name that ends in
<SAMP>`.c'</SAMP>.  <SAMP>`s.%.c'</SAMP> as a pattern matches any file name that starts
with <SAMP>`s.'</SAMP>, ends in <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> and is at least five characters long.
(There must be at least one character to match the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>.)  The substring
that the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> matches is called the <STRONG>stem</STRONG>.
</P>
<P>
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP> in a prerequisite of a pattern rule stands for the same stem
that was matched by the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> in the target.  In order for
the pattern rule to apply, its target pattern must match the file name
under consideration, and its prerequisite patterns must name files that
exist or can be made.  These files become prerequisites of the target.
<A NAME="IDX832"></A>

</P>
<P>
Thus, a rule of the form

</P>

<PRE>
%.o : %.c ; <VAR>command</VAR>...
</PRE>

<P>
specifies how to make a file <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.o'</TT>, with another file
<TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.c'</TT> as its prerequisite, provided that <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.c'</TT>
exists or can be made.

</P>
<P>
There may also be prerequisites that do not use <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>; such a prerequisite
attaches to every file made by this pattern rule.  These unvarying
prerequisites are useful occasionally.

</P>
<P>
A pattern rule need not have any prerequisites that contain <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>, or
in fact any prerequisites at all.  Such a rule is effectively a general
wildcard.  It provides a way to make any file that matches the target
pattern.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC105">Defining Last-Resort Default Rules</A>.

</P>
<P>
Pattern rules may have more than one target.  Unlike normal rules, this
does not act as many different rules with the same prerequisites and
commands.  If a pattern rule has multiple targets, <CODE>make</CODE> knows that
the rule's commands are responsible for making all of the targets.  The
commands are executed only once to make all the targets.  When searching
for a pattern rule to match a target, the target patterns of a rule other
than the one that matches the target in need of a rule are incidental:
<CODE>make</CODE> worries only about giving commands and prerequisites to the file
presently in question.  However, when this file's commands are run, the
other targets are marked as having been updated themselves.
<A NAME="IDX833"></A>
<A NAME="IDX834"></A>

</P>
<P>
The order in which pattern rules appear in the makefile is important
since this is the order in which they are considered.
Of equally applicable
rules, only the first one found is used.  The rules you write take precedence
over those that are built in.  Note however, that a rule whose
prerequisites actually exist or are mentioned always takes priority over a
rule with prerequisites that must be made by chaining other implicit rules.
<A NAME="IDX835"></A>
<A NAME="IDX836"></A>

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC100" HREF="make.html#TOC100">Pattern Rule Examples</A></H3>

<P>
Here are some examples of pattern rules actually predefined in
<CODE>make</CODE>.  First, the rule that compiles <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> files into <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP>
files:
</P>

<PRE>
%.o : %.c
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $&#60; -o $@
</PRE>

<P>
defines a rule that can make any file <TT>`<VAR>x</VAR>.o'</TT> from
<TT>`<VAR>x</VAR>.c'</TT>.  The command uses the automatic variables <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`$&#60;'</SAMP> to substitute the names of the target file and the source file
in each case where the rule applies (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC101">Automatic Variables</A>).
</P>
<P>
Here is a second built-in rule:

</P>

<PRE>
% :: RCS/%,v
        $(CO) $(COFLAGS) $&#60;
</PRE>

<P>
defines a rule that can make any file <TT>`<VAR>x</VAR>'</TT> whatsoever from a
corresponding file <TT>`<VAR>x</VAR>,v'</TT> in the subdirectory <TT>`RCS'</TT>.  Since
the target is <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>, this rule will apply to any file whatever, provided
the appropriate prerequisite file exists.  The double colon makes the rule
<STRONG>terminal</STRONG>, which means that its prerequisite may not be an intermediate
file (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC103">Match-Anything Pattern Rules</A>).
</P>
<P>
This pattern rule has two targets:

</P>

<PRE>
%.tab.c %.tab.h: %.y
        bison -d $&#60;
</PRE>

<P>
This tells <CODE>make</CODE> that the command <SAMP>`bison -d <VAR>x</VAR>.y'</SAMP> will
make both <TT>`<VAR>x</VAR>.tab.c'</TT> and <TT>`<VAR>x</VAR>.tab.h'</TT>.  If the file
<TT>`foo'</TT> depends on the files <TT>`parse.tab.o'</TT> and <TT>`scan.o'</TT>
and the file <TT>`scan.o'</TT> depends on the file <TT>`parse.tab.h'</TT>,
when <TT>`parse.y'</TT> is changed, the command <SAMP>`bison -d parse.y'</SAMP>
will be executed only once, and the prerequisites of both
<TT>`parse.tab.o'</TT> and <TT>`scan.o'</TT> will be satisfied.  (Presumably
the file <TT>`parse.tab.o'</TT> will be recompiled from <TT>`parse.tab.c'</TT>
and the file <TT>`scan.o'</TT> from <TT>`scan.c'</TT>, while <TT>`foo'</TT> is
linked from <TT>`parse.tab.o'</TT>, <TT>`scan.o'</TT>, and its other
prerequisites, and it will execute happily ever after.)

</P>
<P>
Suppose you are writing a pattern rule to compile a <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> file into a
<SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> file: how do you write the <SAMP>`cc'</SAMP> command so that it operates
on the right source file name?  You cannot write the name in the command,
because the name is different each time the implicit rule is applied.

</P>
<P>
What you do is use a special feature of <CODE>make</CODE>, the <STRONG>automatic
variables</STRONG>.  These variables have values computed afresh for each rule that
is executed, based on the target and prerequisites of the rule.  In this
example, you would use <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> for the object file name and <SAMP>`$&#60;'</SAMP>
for the source file name.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>$@</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX840"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX841"></A>
 
The file name of the target of the rule.  If the target is an archive
member, then <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> is the name of the archive file.  In a pattern
rule that has multiple targets (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC99">Introduction to Pattern Rules</A>), <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> is the name of whichever target caused the
rule's commands to be run.

<A NAME="IDX842"></A>
<A NAME="IDX843"></A>
<DT><CODE>$%</CODE>
<DD>
The target member name, when the target is an archive member.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC108">Using <CODE>make</CODE> to Update Archive Files</A>.  For example, if the target is <TT>`foo.a(bar.o)'</TT> then
<SAMP>`$%'</SAMP> is <TT>`bar.o'</TT> and <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> is <TT>`foo.a'</TT>.  <SAMP>`$%'</SAMP> is
empty when the target is not an archive member.

<A NAME="IDX844"></A>
<A NAME="IDX845"></A>
<DT><CODE>$&#60;</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the first prerequisite.  If the target got its commands from
an implicit rule, this will be the first prerequisite added by the
implicit rule (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC93">Using Implicit Rules</A>).

<A NAME="IDX846"></A>
<A NAME="IDX847"></A>
<DT><CODE>$?</CODE>
<DD>
The names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target, with
spaces between them.  For prerequisites which are archive members, only
the member named is used (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC108">Using <CODE>make</CODE> to Update Archive Files</A>).
<A NAME="IDX848"></A>
<A NAME="IDX849"></A>

<A NAME="IDX850"></A>
<A NAME="IDX851"></A>
<DT><CODE>$^</CODE>
<DD>
The names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them.  For
prerequisites which are archive members, only the member named is used
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC108">Using <CODE>make</CODE> to Update Archive Files</A>).  A target has only one prerequisite on each other file
it depends on, no matter how many times each file is listed as a
prerequisite.  So if you list a prerequisite more than once for a target,
the value of <CODE>$^</CODE> contains just one copy of the name.
<A NAME="IDX852"></A>
<A NAME="IDX853"></A>

<A NAME="IDX854"></A>
<A NAME="IDX855"></A>
<DT><CODE>$+</CODE>
<DD>
This is like <SAMP>`$^'</SAMP>, but prerequisites listed more than once are
duplicated in the order they were listed in the makefile.  This is
primarily useful for use in linking commands where it is meaningful to
repeat library file names in a particular order.

<A NAME="IDX856"></A>
<A NAME="IDX857"></A>
<DT><CODE>$*</CODE>
<DD>
The stem with which an implicit rule matches (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC102">How Patterns Match</A>).  If the target is <TT>`dir/a.foo.b'</TT> and the target
pattern is <TT>`a.%.b'</TT> then the stem is <TT>`dir/foo'</TT>.  The stem is
useful for constructing names of related files.<A NAME="IDX858"></A>

In a static pattern rule, the stem is part of the file name that matched
the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> in the target pattern.

In an explicit rule, there is no stem; so <SAMP>`$*'</SAMP> cannot be determined
in that way.  Instead, if the target name ends with a recognized suffix
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC106">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</A>), <SAMP>`$*'</SAMP> is set to
the target name minus the suffix.  For example, if the target name is
<SAMP>`foo.c'</SAMP>, then <SAMP>`$*'</SAMP> is set to <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP>, since <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> is a
suffix.  GNU <CODE>make</CODE> does this bizarre thing only for compatibility
with other implementations of <CODE>make</CODE>.  You should generally avoid
using <SAMP>`$*'</SAMP> except in implicit rules or static pattern rules.
If the target name in an explicit rule does not end with a recognized
suffix, <SAMP>`$*'</SAMP> is set to the empty string for that rule.
</DL>

<P>
<SAMP>`$?'</SAMP> is useful even in explicit rules when you wish to operate on only
the prerequisites that have changed.  For example, suppose that an archive
named <TT>`lib'</TT> is supposed to contain copies of several object files.
This rule copies just the changed object files into the archive:

</P>

<PRE>
lib: foo.o bar.o lose.o win.o
        ar r lib $?
</PRE>

<P>
Of the variables listed above, four have values that are single file
names, and three have values that are lists of file names.  These seven
have variants that get just the file's directory name or just the file
name within the directory.  The variant variables' names are formed by
appending <SAMP>`D'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`F'</SAMP>, respectively.  These variants are
semi-obsolete in GNU <CODE>make</CODE> since the functions <CODE>dir</CODE> and
<CODE>notdir</CODE> can be used to get a similar effect (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC78">Functions for File Names</A>).  Note, however, that the
<SAMP>`F'</SAMP> variants all omit the trailing slash which always appears in

The directory part of the file name of the target, with the trailing

<SAMP>`$(@D)'</SAMP> is <TT>`dir'</TT>.  This value is <TT>`.'</TT> if <SAMP>`$@'</SAMP> does

Note that we use a special stylistic convention when we talk about these
automatic variables; we write "the value of <SAMP>`$&#60;'</SAMP>", rather than
"the variable <CODE>&#60;</CODE>" as we would write for ordinary variables
such as <CODE>objects</CODE> and <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>.  We think this convention
looks more natural in this special case.  Please do not assume it has a
deep significance; <SAMP>`$&#60;'</SAMP> refers to the variable named <CODE>&#60;</CODE> just
as <SAMP>`$(CFLAGS)'</SAMP> refers to the variable named <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>.
You could just as well use <SAMP>`$(&#60;)'</SAMP> in place of <SAMP>`$&#60;'</SAMP>.

<H3><A NAME="SEC102" HREF="make.html#TOC102">How Patterns Match</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX883"></A>
A target pattern is composed of a <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> between a prefix and a suffix,
either or both of which may be empty.  The pattern matches a file name only
if the file name starts with the prefix and ends with the suffix, without
overlap.  The text between the prefix and the suffix is called the
<STRONG>stem</STRONG>.  Thus, when the pattern <SAMP>`%.o'</SAMP> matches the file name
<TT>`test.o'</TT>, the stem is <SAMP>`test'</SAMP>.  The pattern rule prerequisites are
turned into actual file names by substituting the stem for the character
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP>.  Thus, if in the same example one of the prerequisites is written
as <SAMP>`%.c'</SAMP>, it expands to <SAMP>`test.c'</SAMP>.
</P>
<P>
When the target pattern does not contain a slash (and it usually does
not), directory names in the file names are removed from the file name
before it is compared with the target prefix and suffix.  After the
comparison of the file name to the target pattern, the directory
names, along with the slash that ends them, are added on to the
prerequisite file names generated from the pattern rule's prerequisite
patterns and the file name. The directories are ignored only for the
purpose of finding an implicit rule to use, not in the application of
that rule.  Thus, <SAMP>`e%t'</SAMP> matches the file name <TT>`src/eat'</TT>,
with <SAMP>`src/a'</SAMP> as the stem.  When prerequisites are turned into file
names, the directories from the stem are added at the front, while the
rest of the stem is substituted for the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>.  The stem
<SAMP>`src/a'</SAMP> with a prerequisite pattern <SAMP>`c%r'</SAMP> gives the file name
<TT>`src/car'</TT>.
</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC103" HREF="make.html#TOC103">Match-Anything Pattern Rules</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX884"></A>
<A NAME="IDX885"></A>
When a pattern rule's target is just <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>, it matches any file name
whatever.  We call these rules <STRONG>match-anything</STRONG> rules.  They are very
useful, but it can take a lot of time for <CODE>make</CODE> to think about them,
because it must consider every such rule for each file name listed either
as a target or as a prerequisite.

</P>
<P>
Suppose the makefile mentions <TT>`foo.c'</TT>.  For this target, <CODE>make</CODE>
would have to consider making it by linking an object file <TT>`foo.c.o'</TT>,
or by C compilation-and-linking in one step from <TT>`foo.c.c'</TT>, or by
Pascal compilation-and-linking from <TT>`foo.c.p'</TT>, and many other
possibilities.

</P>
<P>
We know these possibilities are ridiculous since <TT>`foo.c'</TT> is a C source
file, not an executable.  If <CODE>make</CODE> did consider these possibilities,
it would ultimately reject them, because files such as <TT>`foo.c.o'</TT> and
<TT>`foo.c.p'</TT> would not exist.  But these possibilities are so
numerous that <CODE>make</CODE> would run very slowly if it had to consider
them.
</P>
<P>
To gain speed, we have put various constraints on the way <CODE>make</CODE>
considers match-anything rules.  There are two different constraints that
can be applied, and each time you define a match-anything rule you must
choose one or the other for that rule.

</P>
<P>
One choice is to mark the match-anything rule as <STRONG>terminal</STRONG> by defining
it with a double colon.  When a rule is terminal, it does not apply unless
its prerequisites actually exist.  Prerequisites that could be made with
other implicit rules are not good enough.  In other words, no further
chaining is allowed beyond a terminal rule.

</P>
<P>
For example, the built-in implicit rules for extracting sources from RCS
and SCCS files are terminal; as a result, if the file <TT>`foo.c,v'</TT> does
not exist, <CODE>make</CODE> will not even consider trying to make it as an
intermediate file from <TT>`foo.c,v.o'</TT> or from <TT>`RCS/SCCS/s.foo.c,v'</TT>.
RCS and SCCS files are generally ultimate source files, which should not be
remade from any other files; therefore, <CODE>make</CODE> can save time by not
looking for ways to remake them.
</P>
<P>
If you do not mark the match-anything rule as terminal, then it is
nonterminal.  A nonterminal match-anything rule cannot apply to a file name
that indicates a specific type of data.  A file name indicates a specific
type of data if some non-match-anything implicit rule target matches it.

</P>
<P>
For example, the file name <TT>`foo.c'</TT> matches the target for the pattern
rule <SAMP>`%.c : %.y'</SAMP> (the rule to run Yacc).  Regardless of whether this
rule is actually applicable (which happens only if there is a file
<TT>`foo.y'</TT>), the fact that its target matches is enough to prevent
consideration of any nonterminal match-anything rules for the file
<TT>`foo.c'</TT>.  Thus, <CODE>make</CODE> will not even consider trying to make
<TT>`foo.c'</TT> as an executable file from <TT>`foo.c.o'</TT>, <TT>`foo.c.c'</TT>,
<TT>`foo.c.p'</TT>, etc.
</P>
<P>
The motivation for this constraint is that nonterminal match-anything
rules are used for making files containing specific types of data (such as
executable files) and a file name with a recognized suffix indicates some
other specific type of data (such as a C source file).

</P>
<P>
Special built-in dummy pattern rules are provided solely to recognize
certain file names so that nonterminal match-anything rules will not be
considered.  These dummy rules have no prerequisites and no commands, and
they are ignored for all other purposes.  For example, the built-in
implicit rule

</P>

<PRE>
%.p :
</PRE>

<P>
exists to make sure that Pascal source files such as <TT>`foo.p'</TT> match a
specific target pattern and thereby prevent time from being wasted looking
for <TT>`foo.p.o'</TT> or <TT>`foo.p.c'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
Dummy pattern rules such as the one for <SAMP>`%.p'</SAMP> are made for every
suffix listed as valid for use in suffix rules (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC106">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</A>).

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC104" HREF="make.html#TOC104">Canceling Implicit Rules</A></H3>

<P>
You can override a built-in implicit rule (or one you have defined
yourself) by defining a new pattern rule with the same target and
prerequisites, but different commands.  When the new rule is defined, the
built-in one is replaced.  The new rule's position in the sequence of
implicit rules is determined by where you write the new rule.

</P>
<P>
You can cancel a built-in implicit rule by defining a pattern rule with the
same target and prerequisites, but no commands.  For example, the following
would cancel the rule that runs the assembler:

</P>

<PRE>
%.o : %.s
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC105" HREF="make.html#TOC105">Defining Last-Resort Default Rules</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX886"></A>
<A NAME="IDX887"></A>

</P>
<P>
You can define a last-resort implicit rule by writing a terminal
match-anything pattern rule with no prerequisites (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC103">Match-Anything Pattern Rules</A>).  This is just like any other pattern rule; the only thing
special about it is that it will match any target.  So such a rule's
commands are used for all targets and prerequisites that have no commands
of their own and for which no other implicit rule applies.

</P>
<P>
For example, when testing a makefile, you might not care if the source
files contain real data, only that they exist.  Then you might do this:

</P>

<PRE>
%::
        touch $@
</PRE>

<P>
to cause all the source files needed (as prerequisites) to be created
automatically.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX888"></A>
You can instead define commands to be used for targets for which there
are no rules at all, even ones which don't specify commands.  You do
this by writing a rule for the target <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE>.  Such a rule's
commands are used for all prerequisites which do not appear as targets in
any explicit rule, and for which no implicit rule applies.  Naturally,
there is no <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> rule unless you write one.

</P>
<P>
If you use <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> with no commands or prerequisites:

</P>

<PRE>
.DEFAULT:
</PRE>

<P>
the commands previously stored for <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> are cleared.
Then <CODE>make</CODE> acts as if you had never defined <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> at all.

</P>
<P>
If you do not want a target to get the commands from a match-anything
pattern rule or <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE>, but you also do not want any commands
to be run for the target, you can give it empty commands (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC56">Using Empty Commands</A>).
</P>

You can use a last-resort rule to override part of another makefile.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Suffix rules</STRONG> are the old-fashioned way of defining implicit rules for
<CODE>make</CODE>.  Suffix rules are obsolete because pattern rules are more
general and clearer.  They are supported in GNU <CODE>make</CODE> for
compatibility with old makefiles.  They come in two kinds:
<STRONG>double-suffix</STRONG> and <STRONG>single-suffix</STRONG>.
</P>
<P>
A double-suffix rule is defined by a pair of suffixes: the target suffix
and the source suffix.  It matches any file whose name ends with the
target suffix.  The corresponding implicit prerequisite is made by
replacing the target suffix with the source suffix in the file name.  A
two-suffix rule whose target and source suffixes are <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> is equivalent to the pattern rule <SAMP>`%.o : %.c'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
A single-suffix rule is defined by a single suffix, which is the source
suffix.  It matches any file name, and the corresponding implicit
prerequisite name is made by appending the source suffix.  A single-suffix
rule whose source suffix is <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> is equivalent to the pattern rule
<SAMP>`% : %.c'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Suffix rule definitions are recognized by comparing each rule's target
against a defined list of known suffixes.  When <CODE>make</CODE> sees a rule
whose target is a known suffix, this rule is considered a single-suffix
rule.  When <CODE>make</CODE> sees a rule whose target is two known suffixes
concatenated, this rule is taken as a double-suffix rule.

</P>
<P>
For example, <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> are both on the default list of
known suffixes.  Therefore, if you define a rule whose target is
<SAMP>`.c.o'</SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE> takes it to be a double-suffix rule with source
suffix <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> and target suffix <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP>.  Here is the old-fashioned
way to define the rule for compiling a C source file:
</P>

<PRE>
.c.o:
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $&#60;
</PRE>

<P>
Suffix rules cannot have any prerequisites of their own.  If they have any,
they are treated as normal files with funny names, not as suffix rules.
Thus, the rule:

</P>

<PRE>
.c.o: foo.h
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $&#60;
</PRE>

<P>
tells how to make the file <TT>`.c.o'</TT> from the prerequisite file
<TT>`foo.h'</TT>, and is not at all like the pattern rule:

</P>

<PRE>
%.o: %.c foo.h
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $&#60;
</PRE>

<P>
which tells how to make <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> files from <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> files, and makes all
<SAMP>`.o'</SAMP> files using this pattern rule also depend on <TT>`foo.h'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
Suffix rules with no commands are also meaningless.  They do not remove
previous rules as do pattern rules with no commands (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC104">Canceling Implicit Rules</A>).  They simply enter the suffix or pair of suffixes concatenated as
a target in the data base.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX891"></A>
The known suffixes are simply the names of the prerequisites of the special
target <CODE>.SUFFIXES</CODE>.  You can add your own suffixes by writing a rule
for <CODE>.SUFFIXES</CODE> that adds more prerequisites, as in:

</P>

<PRE>
.SUFFIXES: .hack .win
</PRE>

<P>
which adds <SAMP>`.hack'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`.win'</SAMP> to the end of the list of suffixes.

</P>
<P>
If you wish to eliminate the default known suffixes instead of just adding
to them, write a rule for <CODE>.SUFFIXES</CODE> with no prerequisites.  By
special dispensation, this eliminates all existing prerequisites of
<CODE>.SUFFIXES</CODE>.  You can then write another rule to add the suffixes you
want.  For example,

</P>

<PRE>
.SUFFIXES:            # Delete the default suffixes
.SUFFIXES: .c .o .h   # Define our suffix list
</PRE>

<P>
The <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--no-builtin-rules'</SAMP> flag causes the default
list of suffixes to be empty.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX892"></A>
The variable <CODE>SUFFIXES</CODE> is defined to the default list of suffixes
before <CODE>make</CODE> reads any makefiles.  You can change the list of suffixes
with a rule for the special target <CODE>.SUFFIXES</CODE>, but that does not alter
this variable.

<A NAME="IDX894"></A>

</P>
<P>
Here is the procedure <CODE>make</CODE> uses for searching for an implicit rule
for a target <VAR>t</VAR>.  This procedure is followed for each double-colon
rule with no commands, for each target of ordinary rules none of which have
commands, and for each prerequisite that is not the target of any rule.  It
is also followed recursively for prerequisites that come from implicit
rules, in the search for a chain of rules.

</P>
<P>
Suffix rules are not mentioned in this algorithm because suffix rules are
converted to equivalent pattern rules once the makefiles have been read in.

</P>
<P>
For an archive member target of the form
<SAMP>`<VAR>archive</VAR>(<VAR>member</VAR>)'</SAMP>, the following algorithm is run
twice, first using the entire target name <VAR>t</VAR>, and second using
<SAMP>`(<VAR>member</VAR>)'</SAMP> as the target <VAR>t</VAR> if the first run found no
rule.
</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Split <VAR>t</VAR> into a directory part, called <VAR>d</VAR>, and the rest,
called <VAR>n</VAR>.  For example, if <VAR>t</VAR> is <SAMP>`src/foo.o'</SAMP>, then
<VAR>d</VAR> is <SAMP>`src/'</SAMP> and <VAR>n</VAR> is <SAMP>`foo.o'</SAMP>.
<LI>

Make a list of all the pattern rules one of whose targets matches
<VAR>t</VAR> or <VAR>n</VAR>.  If the target pattern contains a slash, it is
matched against <VAR>t</VAR>; otherwise, against <VAR>n</VAR>.

<LI>

If any rule in that list is <EM>not</EM> a match-anything rule, then
remove all nonterminal match-anything rules from the list.

<LI>

Remove from the list all rules with no commands.

<LI>

For each pattern rule in the list:


<OL>
<LI>

Find the stem <VAR>s</VAR>, which is the nonempty part of <VAR>t</VAR> or <VAR>n</VAR>
matched by the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> in the target pattern.
<LI>

Compute the prerequisite names by substituting <VAR>s</VAR> for <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>; if
the target pattern does not contain a slash, append <VAR>d</VAR> to
the front of each prerequisite name.
<LI>

Test whether all the prerequisites exist or ought to exist.  (If a
file name is mentioned in the makefile as a target or as an explicit
prerequisite, then we say it ought to exist.)

If all prerequisites exist or ought to exist, or there are no prerequisites,
then this rule applies.

When the commands of a pattern rule are executed for <VAR>t</VAR>, the automatic

<P>
<A NAME="IDX895"></A>

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Archive files</STRONG> are files containing named subfiles called
<STRONG>members</STRONG>; they are maintained with the program <CODE>ar</CODE> and their
main use is as subroutine libraries for linking.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC109" HREF="make.html#TOC109">Archive Members as Targets</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX896"></A>

</P>
<P>
An individual member of an archive file can be used as a target or
prerequisite in <CODE>make</CODE>.  You specify the member named <VAR>member</VAR> in
archive file <VAR>archive</VAR> as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>archive</VAR>(<VAR>member</VAR>)
</PRE>

<P>
This construct is available only in targets and prerequisites, not in
commands!  Most programs that you might use in commands do not support this
syntax and cannot act directly on archive members.  Only <CODE>ar</CODE> and
other programs specifically designed to operate on archives can do so.
Therefore, valid commands to update an archive member target probably must
use <CODE>ar</CODE>.  For example, this rule says to create a member
<TT>`hack.o'</TT> in archive <TT>`foolib'</TT> by copying the file <TT>`hack.o'</TT>:

</P>

<PRE>
foolib(hack.o) : hack.o
        ar cr foolib hack.o
</PRE>

<P>
In fact, nearly all archive member targets are updated in just this way
and there is an implicit rule to do it for you.  <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> The
<SAMP>`c'</SAMP> flag to <CODE>ar</CODE> is required if the archive file does not
already exist.

</P>
<P>
To specify several members in the same archive, you can write all the
member names together between the parentheses.  For example:

</P>

<PRE>
foolib(hack.o kludge.o)
</PRE>

<P>
is equivalent to:

</P>

<PRE>
foolib(hack.o) foolib(kludge.o)
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX897"></A>
You can also use shell-style wildcards in an archive member reference.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC22">Using Wildcard Characters in File Names</A>.  For
example, <SAMP>`foolib(*.o)'</SAMP> expands to all existing members of the
<TT>`foolib'</TT> archive whose names end in <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP>; perhaps
<SAMP>`foolib(hack.o) foolib(kludge.o)'</SAMP>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC110" HREF="make.html#TOC110">Implicit Rule for Archive Member Targets</A></H2>

<P>
Recall that a target that looks like <TT>`<VAR>a</VAR>(<VAR>m</VAR>)'</TT> stands for the
member named <VAR>m</VAR> in the archive file <VAR>a</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
When <CODE>make</CODE> looks for an implicit rule for such a target, as a special
feature it considers implicit rules that match <TT>`(<VAR>m</VAR>)'</TT>, as well as
those that match the actual target <TT>`<VAR>a</VAR>(<VAR>m</VAR>)'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
This causes one special rule whose target is <TT>`(%)'</TT> to match.  This
rule updates the target <TT>`<VAR>a</VAR>(<VAR>m</VAR>)'</TT> by copying the file <VAR>m</VAR>
into the archive.  For example, it will update the archive member target
<TT>`foo.a(bar.o)'</TT> by copying the <EM>file</EM> <TT>`bar.o'</TT> into the
archive <TT>`foo.a'</TT> as a <EM>member</EM> named <TT>`bar.o'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
When this rule is chained with others, the result is very powerful.
Thus, <SAMP>`make "foo.a(bar.o)"'</SAMP> (the quotes are needed to protect the
<SAMP>`('</SAMP> and <SAMP>`)'</SAMP> from being interpreted specially by the shell) in
the presence of a file <TT>`bar.c'</TT> is enough to cause the following
commands to be run, even without a makefile:

</P>

<PRE>
cc -c bar.c -o bar.o
ar r foo.a bar.o
rm -f bar.o
</PRE>

<P>
Here <CODE>make</CODE> has envisioned the file <TT>`bar.o'</TT> as an intermediate
file.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC97">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>.

</P>
<P>
Implicit rules such as this one are written using the automatic variable
<SAMP>`$%'</SAMP>.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC101">Automatic Variables</A>.

</P>
<P>
An archive member name in an archive cannot contain a directory name, but
it may be useful in a makefile to pretend that it does.  If you write an
archive member target <TT>`foo.a(dir/file.o)'</TT>, <CODE>make</CODE> will perform
automatic updating with this command:

</P>

<PRE>
ar r foo.a dir/file.o
</PRE>

<P>
which has the effect of copying the file <TT>`dir/file.o'</TT> into a member
named <TT>`file.o'</TT>.  In connection with such usage, the automatic variables
<CODE>%D</CODE> and <CODE>%F</CODE> may be useful.

</P>

<P>
An archive file that is used as a library usually contains a special member
named <TT>`__.SYMDEF'</TT> that contains a directory of the external symbol
names defined by all the other members.  After you update any other
members, you need to update <TT>`__.SYMDEF'</TT> so that it will summarize the
other members properly.  This is done by running the <CODE>ranlib</CODE> program:

</P>

<PRE>
ranlib <VAR>archivefile</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
Normally you would put this command in the rule for the archive file,
and make all the members of the archive file prerequisites of that rule.
For example,

</P>

<PRE>
libfoo.a: libfoo.a(x.o) libfoo.a(y.o) ...
        ranlib libfoo.a
</PRE>

<P>
The effect of this is to update archive members <TT>`x.o'</TT>, <TT>`y.o'</TT>,
etc., and then update the symbol directory member <TT>`__.SYMDEF'</TT> by
running <CODE>ranlib</CODE>.  The rules for updating the members are not shown
here; most likely you can omit them and use the implicit rule which copies
files into the archive, as described in the preceding section.

</P>
<P>
This is not necessary when using the GNU <CODE>ar</CODE> program, which
updates the <TT>`__.SYMDEF'</TT> member automatically.

It is important to be careful when using parallel execution (the
<CODE>-j</CODE> switch; see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC47">Parallel Execution</A>) and archives.
If multiple <CODE>ar</CODE> commands run at the same time on the same archive
file, they will not know about each other and can corrupt the file.

</P>
<P>
Possibly a future version of <CODE>make</CODE> will provide a mechanism to
circumvent this problem by serializing all commands that operate on the
same archive file.  But for the time being, you must either write your
makefiles to avoid this problem in some other way, or not use <CODE>-j</CODE>.

You can write a special kind of suffix rule for dealing with archive
files.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC106">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</A>, for a full explanation of suffix rules.
Archive suffix rules are obsolete in GNU <CODE>make</CODE>, because pattern
rules for archives are a more general mechanism (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC110">Implicit Rule for Archive Member Targets</A>).  But they are retained for compatibility with other
<CODE>make</CODE>s.

</P>
<P>
To write a suffix rule for archives, you simply write a suffix rule
using the target suffix <SAMP>`.a'</SAMP> (the usual suffix for archive files).
For example, here is the old-fashioned suffix rule to update a library
archive from C source files:

</P>

<PRE>
.c.a:
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $&#60; -o $*.o
        $(AR) r $@ $*.o
        $(RM) $*.o
</PRE>

<P>
This works just as if you had written the pattern rule:

</P>

<PRE>
(%.o): %.c
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $&#60; -o $*.o
        $(AR) r $@ $*.o
        $(RM) $*.o
</PRE>

<P>
In fact, this is just what <CODE>make</CODE> does when it sees a suffix rule
with <SAMP>`.a'</SAMP> as the target suffix.  Any double-suffix rule
<SAMP>`.<VAR>x</VAR>.a'</SAMP> is converted to a pattern rule with the target
pattern <SAMP>`(%.o)'</SAMP> and a prerequisite pattern of <SAMP>`%.<VAR>x</VAR>'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Since you might want to use <SAMP>`.a'</SAMP> as the suffix for some other kind
of file, <CODE>make</CODE> also converts archive suffix rules to pattern rules
in the normal way (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC106">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</A>).  Thus a double-suffix rule
<SAMP>`.<VAR>x</VAR>.a'</SAMP> produces two pattern rules: <SAMP>`(%.o):
%.<VAR>x</VAR>'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`%.a: %.<VAR>x</VAR>'</SAMP>.

Here is a summary of the features of GNU <CODE>make</CODE>, for comparison
with and credit to other versions of <CODE>make</CODE>.  We consider the
features of <CODE>make</CODE> in 4.2 BSD systems as a baseline.  If you are
concerned with writing portable makefiles, you should not use the
features of <CODE>make</CODE> listed here, nor the ones in section <A HREF="make.html#SEC115">Incompatibilities and Missing Features</A>.

</P>
<P>
Many features come from the version of <CODE>make</CODE> in System V.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The <CODE>VPATH</CODE> variable and its special meaning.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC26">Searching Directories for Prerequisites</A>.
This feature exists in System V <CODE>make</CODE>, but is undocumented.
It is documented in 4.3 BSD <CODE>make</CODE> (which says it mimics System V's
<CODE>VPATH</CODE> feature).
<LI>

Included makefiles.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC15">Including Other Makefiles</A>.
Allowing multiple files to be included with a single directive is a GNU
extension.

<LI>

Variables are read from and communicated via the environment.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC68">Variables from the Environment</A>.

<LI>

Options passed through the variable <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> to recursive
invocations of <CODE>make</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC53">Communicating Options to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>.

<LI>

The automatic variable <CODE>$%</CODE> is set to the member name
in an archive reference.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC101">Automatic Variables</A>.

<LI>

The automatic variables <CODE>$@</CODE>, <CODE>$*</CODE>, <CODE>$&#60;</CODE>, <CODE>$%</CODE>,
and <CODE>$?</CODE> have corresponding forms like <CODE>$(@F)</CODE> and
<CODE>$(@D)</CODE>.  We have generalized this to <CODE>$^</CODE> as an obvious
extension.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC101">Automatic Variables</A>.
<LI>

Substitution variable references.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC58">Basics of Variable References</A>.

<LI>

The command-line options <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP>, accepted and
ignored.  In System V <CODE>make</CODE>, these options actually do something.

<LI>

Execution of recursive commands to run <CODE>make</CODE> via the variable
<CODE>MAKE</CODE> even if <SAMP>`-n'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-q'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-t'</SAMP> is specified.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC50">Recursive Use of <CODE>make</CODE></A>.

<LI>

Support for suffix <SAMP>`.a'</SAMP> in suffix rules.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC113">Suffix Rules for Archive Files</A>.  This feature is obsolete in GNU <CODE>make</CODE>, because the
general feature of rule chaining (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC97">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>) allows one pattern rule for installing members in an
archive (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC110">Implicit Rule for Archive Member Targets</A>) to be sufficient.

<LI>

The arrangement of lines and backslash-newline combinations in
commands is retained when the commands are printed, so they appear as
they do in the makefile, except for the stripping of initial
whitespace.
</UL>

<P>
The following features were inspired by various other versions of
<CODE>make</CODE>.  In some cases it is unclear exactly which versions inspired
which others.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Pattern rules using <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>.
This has been implemented in several versions of <CODE>make</CODE>.
We're not sure who invented it first, but it's been spread around a bit.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC98">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</A>.
<LI>

Rule chaining and implicit intermediate files.
This was implemented by Stu Feldman in his version of <CODE>make</CODE>
for AT&#38;T Eighth Edition Research Unix, and later by Andrew Hume of
AT&#38;T Bell Labs in his <CODE>mk</CODE> program (where he terms it
"transitive closure").  We do not really know if
we got this from either of them or thought it up ourselves at the
same time.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC97">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>.

<LI>

The automatic variable <CODE>$^</CODE> containing a list of all prerequisites
of the current target.  We did not invent this, but we have no idea who
did.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC101">Automatic Variables</A>.  The automatic variable
<CODE>$+</CODE> is a simple extension of <CODE>$^</CODE>.

<LI>

The "what if" flag (<SAMP>`-W'</SAMP> in GNU <CODE>make</CODE>) was (as far as we know)
invented by Andrew Hume in <CODE>mk</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC88">Instead of Executing the Commands</A>.

<LI>

The concept of doing several things at once (parallelism) exists in
many incarnations of <CODE>make</CODE> and similar programs, though not in the
System V or BSD implementations.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC46">Command Execution</A>.

<LI>

Modified variable references using pattern substitution come from
SunOS 4.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC58">Basics of Variable References</A>.
This functionality was provided in GNU <CODE>make</CODE> by the
<CODE>patsubst</CODE> function before the alternate syntax was implemented
for compatibility with SunOS 4.  It is not altogether clear who
inspired whom, since GNU <CODE>make</CODE> had <CODE>patsubst</CODE> before SunOS
4 was released.
<LI>

The special significance of <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> characters preceding command lines
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC88">Instead of Executing the Commands</A>) is
mandated by
<CITE>IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992</CITE> (POSIX.2).

<LI>

The <SAMP>`+='</SAMP> syntax to append to the value of a variable comes from SunOS
4 <CODE>make</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC65">Appending More Text to Variables</A>.

<LI>

The syntax <SAMP>`<VAR>archive</VAR>(<VAR>mem1</VAR> <VAR>mem2</VAR>...)'</SAMP> to list
multiple members in a single archive file comes from SunOS 4 <CODE>make</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC109">Archive Members as Targets</A>.

<LI>

The <CODE>-include</CODE> directive to include makefiles with no error for a
nonexistent file comes from SunOS 4 <CODE>make</CODE>.  (But note that SunOS 4
<CODE>make</CODE> does not allow multiple makefiles to be specified in one
<CODE>-include</CODE> directive.)  The same feature appears with the name
<CODE>sinclude</CODE> in SGI <CODE>make</CODE> and perhaps others.
</UL>

<P>
The remaining features are inventions new in GNU <CODE>make</CODE>:

Andrew Hume of AT&#38;T Bell Labs implemented a similar feature with a

Conditional execution.

This feature has been implemented numerous times in various versions
of <CODE>make</CODE>; it seems a natural extension derived from the features
of the C preprocessor and similar macro languages and is not a
revolutionary concept.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC71">Conditional Parts of Makefiles</A>.

Allow suffixes for suffix rules
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC106">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</A>) to contain any

<SAMP>`.'</SAMP> and not contain any <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> characters.

The <CODE>make</CODE> programs in various other systems support a few features
that are not implemented in GNU <CODE>make</CODE>.  The POSIX.2 standard
(<CITE>IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992</CITE>) which specifies <CODE>make</CODE> does not
require any of these features.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A target of the form <SAMP>`<VAR>file</VAR>((<VAR>entry</VAR>))'</SAMP> stands for a member
of archive file <VAR>file</VAR>.  The member is chosen, not by name, but by
being an object file which defines the linker symbol <VAR>entry</VAR>.
This feature was not put into GNU <CODE>make</CODE> because of the
nonmodularity of putting knowledge into <CODE>make</CODE> of the internal
format of archive file symbol tables.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC111">Updating Archive Symbol Directories</A>.

<LI>

Suffixes (used in suffix rules) that end with the character <SAMP>`~'</SAMP>
have a special meaning to System V <CODE>make</CODE>;
they refer to the SCCS file that corresponds
to the file one would get without the <SAMP>`~'</SAMP>.  For example, the
suffix rule <SAMP>`.c~.o'</SAMP> would make the file <TT>`<VAR>n</VAR>.o'</TT> from
the SCCS file <TT>`s.<VAR>n</VAR>.c'</TT>.  For complete coverage, a whole
series of such suffix rules is required.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC106">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</A>.

In GNU <CODE>make</CODE>, this entire series of cases is handled by two
pattern rules for extraction from SCCS, in combination with the
general feature of rule chaining.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC97">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>.

<LI>

In System V <CODE>make</CODE>, the string <SAMP>`$$@'</SAMP> has the strange meaning
that, in the prerequisites of a rule with multiple targets, it stands
for the particular target that is being processed.

This is not defined in GNU <CODE>make</CODE> because <SAMP>`$$'</SAMP> should always
stand for an ordinary <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>.

It is possible to get portions of this functionality through the use of
static pattern rules (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC39">Static Pattern Rules</A>).
The System V <CODE>make</CODE> rule:


<PRE>
$(targets): $$@.o lib.a
</PRE>

can be replaced with the GNU <CODE>make</CODE> static pattern rule:


<PRE>
$(targets): %: %.o lib.a
</PRE>

<LI>

In System V and 4.3 BSD <CODE>make</CODE>, files found by <CODE>VPATH</CODE> search
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC26">Searching Directories for Prerequisites</A>) have their names changed inside command
strings.  We feel it is much cleaner to always use automatic variables
and thus make this feature obsolete.
<LI>

In some Unix <CODE>make</CODE>s, the automatic variable <CODE>$*</CODE> appearing in
the prerequisites of a rule has the amazingly strange "feature" of
expanding to the full name of the <EM>target of that rule</EM>.  We cannot
imagine what went on in the minds of Unix <CODE>make</CODE> developers to do
this; it is utterly inconsistent with the normal definition of <CODE>$*</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX917"></A>

<LI>

In some Unix <CODE>make</CODE>s, implicit rule search
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC93">Using Implicit Rules</A>) is apparently done for
<EM>all</EM> targets, not just those without commands.  This means you can
do:

<PRE>
foo.o:
        cc -c foo.c
</PRE>

and Unix <CODE>make</CODE> will intuit that <TT>`foo.o'</TT> depends on
<TT>`foo.c'</TT>.
We feel that such usage is broken.  The prerequisite properties of
<CODE>make</CODE> are well-defined (for GNU <CODE>make</CODE>, at least),
and doing such a thing simply does not fit the model.
<LI>

GNU <CODE>make</CODE> does not include any built-in implicit rules for
compiling or preprocessing EFL programs.  If we hear of anyone who is
using EFL, we will gladly add them.

<LI>

It appears that in SVR4 <CODE>make</CODE>, a suffix rule can be specified with
no commands, and it is treated as if it had empty commands
(see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC56">Using Empty Commands</A>).  For example:


<PRE>
.c.a:
</PRE>

will override the built-in <TT>`.c.a'</TT> suffix rule.

We feel that it is cleaner for a rule without commands to always simply
add to the prerequisite list for the target.  The above example can be
easily rewritten to get the desired behavior in GNU <CODE>make</CODE>:


<PRE>
.c.a: ;
</PRE>

<LI>

Some versions of <CODE>make</CODE> invoke the shell with the <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> flag,
except under <SAMP>`-k'</SAMP> (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC91">Testing the Compilation of a Program</A>).  The <SAMP>`-e'</SAMP> flag tells the shell to exit as soon as any
program it runs returns a nonzero status.  We feel it is cleaner to
write each shell command line to stand on its own and not require this
special treatment.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX918"></A>
<A NAME="IDX919"></A>
<A NAME="IDX920"></A>

</P>
<P>
This
chapter
describes conventions for writing the Makefiles for GNU programs.
Using Automake will help you write a Makefile that follows these
conventions.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC117" HREF="make.html#TOC117">General Conventions for Makefiles</A></H2>

<P>
Every Makefile should contain this line:

</P>

<PRE>
SHELL = /bin/sh
</PRE>

<P>
to avoid trouble on systems where the <CODE>SHELL</CODE> variable might be
inherited from the environment.  (This is never a problem with GNU
<CODE>make</CODE>.)

</P>
<P>
Different <CODE>make</CODE> programs have incompatible suffix lists and
implicit rules, and this sometimes creates confusion or misbehavior.  So
it is a good idea to set the suffix list explicitly using only the
suffixes you need in the particular Makefile, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
.SUFFIXES:
.SUFFIXES: .c .o
</PRE>

<P>
The first line clears out the suffix list, the second introduces all
suffixes which may be subject to implicit rules in this Makefile.

</P>
<P>
Don't assume that <TT>`.'</TT> is in the path for command execution.  When
you need to run programs that are a part of your package during the
make, please make sure that it uses <TT>`./'</TT> if the program is built as
part of the make or <TT>`$(srcdir)/'</TT> if the file is an unchanging part
of the source code.  Without one of these prefixes, the current search
path is used.

</P>
<P>
The distinction between <TT>`./'</TT> (the <STRONG>build directory</STRONG>) and
<TT>`$(srcdir)/'</TT> (the <STRONG>source directory</STRONG>) is important because
users can build in a separate directory using the <SAMP>`--srcdir'</SAMP> option
to <TT>`configure'</TT>.  A rule of the form:

</P>

<PRE>
foo.1 : foo.man sedscript
        sed -e sedscript foo.man &#62; foo.1
</PRE>

<P>
will fail when the build directory is not the source directory, because
<TT>`foo.man'</TT> and <TT>`sedscript'</TT> are in the the source directory.

</P>
<P>
When using GNU <CODE>make</CODE>, relying on <SAMP>`VPATH'</SAMP> to find the source
file will work in the case where there is a single dependency file,
since the <CODE>make</CODE> automatic variable <SAMP>`$&#60;'</SAMP> will represent the
source file wherever it is.  (Many versions of <CODE>make</CODE> set <SAMP>`$&#60;'</SAMP>
only in implicit rules.)  A Makefile target like

</P>

<PRE>
foo.o : bar.c
        $(CC) -I. -I$(srcdir) $(CFLAGS) -c bar.c -o foo.o
</PRE>

<P>
should instead be written as

</P>

<PRE>
foo.o : bar.c
        $(CC) -I. -I$(srcdir) $(CFLAGS) -c $&#60; -o $@
</PRE>

<P>
in order to allow <SAMP>`VPATH'</SAMP> to work correctly.  When the target has
multiple dependencies, using an explicit <SAMP>`$(srcdir)'</SAMP> is the easiest
way to make the rule work well.  For example, the target above for
<TT>`foo.1'</TT> is best written as:

</P>

<PRE>
foo.1 : foo.man sedscript
        sed -e $(srcdir)/sedscript $(srcdir)/foo.man &#62; $@
</PRE>

<P>
GNU distributions usually contain some files which are not source
files--for example, Info files, and the output from Autoconf, Automake,
Bison or Flex.  Since these files normally appear in the source
directory, they should always appear in the source directory, not in the
build directory.  So Makefile rules to update them should put the
updated files in the source directory.

</P>
<P>
However, if a file does not appear in the distribution, then the
Makefile should not put it in the source directory, because building a
program in ordinary circumstances should not modify the source directory
in any way.

</P>
<P>
Try to make the build and installation targets, at least (and all their
subtargets) work correctly with a parallel <CODE>make</CODE>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC118" HREF="make.html#TOC118">Utilities in Makefiles</A></H2>

<P>
Write the Makefile commands (and any shell scripts, such as
<CODE>configure</CODE>) to run in <CODE>sh</CODE>, not in <CODE>csh</CODE>.  Don't use any
special features of <CODE>ksh</CODE> or <CODE>bash</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>configure</CODE> script and the Makefile rules for building and
installation should not use any utilities directly except these:

</P>


<PRE>
cat cmp cp diff echo egrep expr false grep install-info
ln ls mkdir mv pwd rm rmdir sed sleep sort tar test touch true
</PRE>

<P>
The compression program <CODE>gzip</CODE> can be used in the <CODE>dist</CODE> rule.

</P>
<P>
Stick to the generally supported options for these programs.  For
example, don't use <SAMP>`mkdir -p'</SAMP>, convenient as it may be, because
most systems don't support it.

</P>
<P>
It is a good idea to avoid creating symbolic links in makefiles, since a
few systems don't support them.

</P>
<P>
The Makefile rules for building and installation can also use compilers
and related programs, but should do so via <CODE>make</CODE> variables so that the
user can substitute alternatives.  Here are some of the programs we
mean:

</P>

<PRE>
ar bison cc flex install ld ldconfig lex
make makeinfo ranlib texi2dvi yacc
</PRE>

<P>
Use the following <CODE>make</CODE> variables to run those programs:

</P>

<PRE>
$(AR) $(BISON) $(CC) $(FLEX) $(INSTALL) $(LD) $(LDCONFIG) $(LEX)
$(MAKE) $(MAKEINFO) $(RANLIB) $(TEXI2DVI) $(YACC)
</PRE>

<P>
When you use <CODE>ranlib</CODE> or <CODE>ldconfig</CODE>, you should make sure
nothing bad happens if the system does not have the program in question.
Arrange to ignore an error from that command, and print a message before
the command to tell the user that failure of this command does not mean
a problem.  (The Autoconf <SAMP>`AC_PROG_RANLIB'</SAMP> macro can help with
this.)

</P>
<P>
If you use symbolic links, you should implement a fallback for systems
that don't have symbolic links.

</P>
<P>
Additional utilities that can be used via Make variables are:

</P>

<PRE>
chgrp chmod chown mknod
</PRE>

<P>
It is ok to use other utilities in Makefile portions (or scripts)
intended only for particular systems where you know those utilities
exist.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC119" HREF="make.html#TOC119">Variables for Specifying Commands</A></H2>

<P>
Makefiles should provide variables for overriding certain commands, options,
and so on.

</P>
<P>
In particular, you should run most utility programs via variables.
Thus, if you use Bison, have a variable named <CODE>BISON</CODE> whose default
value is set with <SAMP>`BISON = bison'</SAMP>, and refer to it with
<CODE>$(BISON)</CODE> whenever you need to use Bison.

</P>
<P>
File management utilities such as <CODE>ln</CODE>, <CODE>rm</CODE>, <CODE>mv</CODE>, and
so on, need not be referred to through variables in this way, since users
don't need to replace them with other programs.

</P>
<P>
Each program-name variable should come with an options variable that is
used to supply options to the program.  Append <SAMP>`FLAGS'</SAMP> to the
program-name variable name to get the options variable name--for
example, <CODE>BISONFLAGS</CODE>.  (The names <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> for the C
compiler, <CODE>YFLAGS</CODE> for yacc, and <CODE>LFLAGS</CODE> for lex, are
exceptions to this rule, but we keep them because they are standard.)
Use <CODE>CPPFLAGS</CODE> in any compilation command that runs the
preprocessor, and use <CODE>LDFLAGS</CODE> in any compilation command that
does linking as well as in any direct use of <CODE>ld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
If there are C compiler options that <EM>must</EM> be used for proper
compilation of certain files, do not include them in <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>.
Users expect to be able to specify <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> freely themselves.
Instead, arrange to pass the necessary options to the C compiler
independently of <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>, by writing them explicitly in the
compilation commands or by defining an implicit rule, like this:

</P>

<PRE>
CFLAGS = -g
ALL_CFLAGS = -I. $(CFLAGS)
.c.o:
        $(CC) -c $(CPPFLAGS) $(ALL_CFLAGS) $&#60;
</PRE>

<P>
Do include the <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> option in <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>, because that is not
<EM>required</EM> for proper compilation.  You can consider it a default
that is only recommended.  If the package is set up so that it is
compiled with GCC by default, then you might as well include <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>
in the default value of <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> as well.

</P>
<P>
Put <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> last in the compilation command, after other variables
containing compiler options, so the user can use <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> to
override the others.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> should be used in every invocation of the C compiler,
both those which do compilation and those which do linking.

</P>
<P>
Every Makefile should define the variable <CODE>INSTALL</CODE>, which is the
basic command for installing a file into the system.

</P>
<P>
Every Makefile should also define the variables <CODE>INSTALL_PROGRAM</CODE>
and <CODE>INSTALL_DATA</CODE>.  (The default for each of these should be
<CODE>$(INSTALL)</CODE>.)  Then it should use those variables as the commands
for actual installation, for executables and nonexecutables
respectively.  Use these variables as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
$(INSTALL_PROGRAM) foo $(bindir)/foo
$(INSTALL_DATA) libfoo.a $(libdir)/libfoo.a
</PRE>

<P>
Optionally, you may prepend the value of <CODE>DESTDIR</CODE> to the target
filename.  Doing this allows the installer to create a snapshot of the
installation to be copied onto the real target filesystem later.  Do not
set the value of <CODE>DESTDIR</CODE> in your Makefile, and do not include it
in any installed files.  With support for <CODE>DESTDIR</CODE>, the above
examples become:

</P>

<PRE>
$(INSTALL_PROGRAM) foo $(DESTDIR)$(bindir)/foo
$(INSTALL_DATA) libfoo.a $(DESTDIR)$(libdir)/libfoo.a
</PRE>

<P>
Always use a file name, not a directory name, as the second argument of
the installation commands.  Use a separate command for each file to be
installed.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC120" HREF="make.html#TOC120">Variables for Installation Directories</A></H2>

<P>
Installation directories should always be named by variables, so it is
easy to install in a nonstandard place.  The standard names for these
variables are described below.  They are based on a standard filesystem
layout; variants of it are used in SVR4, 4.4BSD, Linux, Ultrix v4, and
other modern operating systems.

</P>
<P>
These two variables set the root for the installation.  All the other
installation directories should be subdirectories of one of these two,
and nothing should be directly installed into these two directories.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`prefix'</SAMP>
<DD>
A prefix used in constructing the default values of the variables listed
below.  The default value of <CODE>prefix</CODE> should be <TT>`/usr/local'</TT>.
When building the complete GNU system, the prefix will be empty and
<TT>`/usr'</TT> will be a symbolic link to <TT>`/'</TT>.
(If you are using Autoconf, write it as <SAMP>`@prefix@'</SAMP>.)

Running <SAMP>`make install'</SAMP> with a different value of <CODE>prefix</CODE>
from the one used to build the program should <VAR>not</VAR> recompile
the program.

<DT><SAMP>`exec_prefix'</SAMP>
<DD>
A prefix used in constructing the default values of some of the
variables listed below.  The default value of <CODE>exec_prefix</CODE> should
be <CODE>$(prefix)</CODE>.
(If you are using Autoconf, write it as <SAMP>`@exec_prefix@'</SAMP>.)

Generally, <CODE>$(exec_prefix)</CODE> is used for directories that contain
machine-specific files (such as executables and subroutine libraries),
while <CODE>$(prefix)</CODE> is used directly for other directories.

Running <SAMP>`make install'</SAMP> with a different value of <CODE>exec_prefix</CODE>
from the one used to build the program should <VAR>not</VAR> recompile the
program.
</DL>

<P>
Executable programs are installed in one of the following directories.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`bindir'</SAMP>
<DD>
The directory for installing executable programs that users can run.
This should normally be <TT>`/usr/local/bin'</TT>, but write it as
<TT>`$(exec_prefix)/bin'</TT>.
(If you are using Autoconf, write it as <SAMP>`@bindir@'</SAMP>.)

<DT><SAMP>`sbindir'</SAMP>
<DD>
The directory for installing executable programs that can be run from
the shell, but are only generally useful to system administrators.  This
should normally be <TT>`/usr/local/sbin'</TT>, but write it as
<TT>`$(exec_prefix)/sbin'</TT>.
(If you are using Autoconf, write it as <SAMP>`@sbindir@'</SAMP>.)

<DT><SAMP>`libexecdir'</SAMP>
<DD>
The directory for installing executable programs to be run by other
programs rather than by users.  This directory should normally be
<TT>`/usr/local/libexec'</TT>, but write it as <TT>`$(exec_prefix)/libexec'</TT>.
(If you are using Autoconf, write it as <SAMP>`@libexecdir@'</SAMP>.)
</DL>

<P>
Data files used by the program during its execution are divided into
categories in two ways.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Some files are normally modified by programs; others are never normally
modified (though users may edit some of these).

<LI>

Some files are architecture-independent and can be shared by all
machines at a site; some are architecture-dependent and can be shared
only by machines of the same kind and operating system; others may never
be shared between two machines.
</UL>

<P>
This makes for six different possibilities.  However, we want to
discourage the use of architecture-dependent files, aside from object
files and libraries.  It is much cleaner to make other data files
architecture-independent, and it is generally not hard.

</P>
<P>
Therefore, here are the variables Makefiles should use to specify
directories:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`datadir'</SAMP>
<DD>
The directory for installing read-only architecture independent data
files.  This should normally be <TT>`/usr/local/share'</TT>, but write it as
<TT>`$(prefix)/share'</TT>.
(If you are using Autoconf, write it as <SAMP>`@datadir@'</SAMP>.)
As a special exception, see <TT>`$(infodir)'</TT>
and <TT>`$(includedir)'</TT> below.

<DT><SAMP>`sysconfdir'</SAMP>
<DD>
The directory for installing read-only data files that pertain to a
single machine--that is to say, files for configuring a host.  Mailer
and network configuration files, <TT>`/etc/passwd'</TT>, and so forth belong
here.  All the files in this directory should be ordinary ASCII text
files.  This directory should normally be <TT>`/usr/local/etc'</TT>, but
write it as <TT>`$(prefix)/etc'</TT>.
(If you are using Autoconf, write it as <SAMP>`@sysconfdir@'</SAMP>.)

Do not install executables here in this directory (they probably belong
in <TT>`$(libexecdir)'</TT> or <TT>`$(sbindir)'</TT>).  Also do not install
files that are modified in the normal course of their use (programs
whose purpose is to change the configuration of the system excluded).
Those probably belong in <TT>`$(localstatedir)'</TT>.

<DT><SAMP>`sharedstatedir'</SAMP>
<DD>
The directory for installing architecture-independent data files which
the programs modify while they run.  This should normally be
<TT>`/usr/local/com'</TT>, but write it as <TT>`$(prefix)/com'</TT>.
(If you are using Autoconf, write it as <SAMP>`@sharedstatedir@'</SAMP>.)

<DT><SAMP>`localstatedir'</SAMP>
<DD>
The directory for installing data files which the programs modify while
they run, and that pertain to one specific machine.  Users should never
need to modify files in this directory to configure the package's
operation; put such configuration information in separate files that go
in <TT>`$(datadir)'</TT> or <TT>`$(sysconfdir)'</TT>.  <TT>`$(localstatedir)'</TT>
should normally be <TT>`/usr/local/var'</TT>, but write it as
<TT>`$(prefix)/var'</TT>.
(If you are using Autoconf, write it as <SAMP>`@localstatedir@'</SAMP>.)

<DT><SAMP>`libdir'</SAMP>
<DD>
The directory for object files and libraries of object code.  Do not
install executables here, they probably ought to go in <TT>`$(libexecdir)'</TT>
instead.  The value of <CODE>libdir</CODE> should normally be
<TT>`/usr/local/lib'</TT>, but write it as <TT>`$(exec_prefix)/lib'</TT>.
(If you are using Autoconf, write it as <SAMP>`@libdir@'</SAMP>.)

<DT><SAMP>`infodir'</SAMP>
<DD>
The directory for installing the Info files for this package.  By
default, it should be <TT>`/usr/local/info'</TT>, but it should be written
as <TT>`$(prefix)/info'</TT>.
(If you are using Autoconf, write it as <SAMP>`@infodir@'</SAMP>.)

<DT><SAMP>`lispdir'</SAMP>
<DD>
The directory for installing any Emacs Lisp files in this package.  By
default, it should be <TT>`/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp'</TT>, but it
should be written as <TT>`$(prefix)/share/emacs/site-lisp'</TT>.

If you are using Autoconf, write the default as <SAMP>`@lispdir@'</SAMP>.
In order to make <SAMP>`@lispdir@'</SAMP> work, you need the following lines
in your <TT>`configure.in'</TT> file:


<PRE>
lispdir='${datadir}/emacs/site-lisp'
AC_SUBST(lispdir)
</PRE>

<DT><SAMP>`includedir'</SAMP>
<DD>
The directory for installing header files to be included by user
programs with the C <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> preprocessor directive.  This
should normally be <TT>`/usr/local/include'</TT>, but write it as
<TT>`$(prefix)/include'</TT>.
(If you are using Autoconf, write it as <SAMP>`@includedir@'</SAMP>.)

Most compilers other than GCC do not look for header files in directory
<TT>`/usr/local/include'</TT>.  So installing the header files this way is
only useful with GCC.  Sometimes this is not a problem because some
libraries are only really intended to work with GCC.  But some libraries
are intended to work with other compilers.  They should install their
header files in two places, one specified by <CODE>includedir</CODE> and one
specified by <CODE>oldincludedir</CODE>.

<DT><SAMP>`oldincludedir'</SAMP>
<DD>
The directory for installing <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP> header files for use with
compilers other than GCC.  This should normally be <TT>`/usr/include'</TT>.
(If you are using Autoconf, you can write it as <SAMP>`@oldincludedir@'</SAMP>.)

The Makefile commands should check whether the value of
<CODE>oldincludedir</CODE> is empty.  If it is, they should not try to use
it; they should cancel the second installation of the header files.

A package should not replace an existing header in this directory unless
the header came from the same package.  Thus, if your Foo package
provides a header file <TT>`foo.h'</TT>, then it should install the header
file in the <CODE>oldincludedir</CODE> directory if either (1) there is no
<TT>`foo.h'</TT> there or (2) the <TT>`foo.h'</TT> that exists came from the Foo
package.

To tell whether <TT>`foo.h'</TT> came from the Foo package, put a magic
string in the file--part of a comment--and <CODE>grep</CODE> for that string.
</DL>

<P>
Unix-style man pages are installed in one of the following:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`mandir'</SAMP>
<DD>
The top-level directory for installing the man pages (if any) for this
package.  It will normally be <TT>`/usr/local/man'</TT>, but you should
write it as <TT>`$(prefix)/man'</TT>.
(If you are using Autoconf, write it as <SAMP>`@mandir@'</SAMP>.)

<DT><SAMP>`man1dir'</SAMP>
<DD>
The directory for installing section 1 man pages.  Write it as
<TT>`$(mandir)/man1'</TT>.
<DT><SAMP>`man2dir'</SAMP>
<DD>
The directory for installing section 2 man pages.  Write it as
<TT>`$(mandir)/man2'</TT>
<DT><SAMP>`...'</SAMP>
<DD>
<STRONG>Don't make the primary documentation for any GNU software be a
man page.  Write a manual in Texinfo instead.  Man pages are just for
the sake of people running GNU software on Unix, which is a secondary
application only.</STRONG>

<DT><SAMP>`manext'</SAMP>
<DD>
The file name extension for the installed man page.  This should contain
a period followed by the appropriate digit; it should normally be <SAMP>`.1'</SAMP>.

<DT><SAMP>`man1ext'</SAMP>
<DD>
The file name extension for installed section 1 man pages.
<DT><SAMP>`man2ext'</SAMP>
<DD>
The file name extension for installed section 2 man pages.
<DT><SAMP>`...'</SAMP>
<DD>
Use these names instead of <SAMP>`manext'</SAMP> if the package needs to install man
pages in more than one section of the manual.
</DL>

<P>
And finally, you should set the following variable:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`srcdir'</SAMP>
<DD>
The directory for the sources being compiled.  The value of this
variable is normally inserted by the <CODE>configure</CODE> shell script.
(If you are using Autconf, use <SAMP>`srcdir = @srcdir@'</SAMP>.)
</DL>

<P>
For example:

</P>

# Common prefix for installation directories.

<P>
If your program installs a large number of files into one of the
standard user-specified directories, it might be useful to group them
into a subdirectory particular to that program.  If you do this, you
should write the <CODE>install</CODE> rule to create these subdirectories.

</P>
<P>
Do not expect the user to include the subdirectory name in the value of
any of the variables listed above.  The idea of having a uniform set of
variable names for installation directories is to enable the user to
specify the exact same values for several different GNU packages.  In
order for this to be useful, all the packages must be designed so that
they will work sensibly when the user does so.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC121" HREF="make.html#TOC121">Standard Targets for Users</A></H2>

<P>
All GNU programs should have the following targets in their Makefiles:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`all'</SAMP>
<DD>
Compile the entire program.  This should be the default target.  This
target need not rebuild any documentation files; Info files should
normally be included in the distribution, and DVI files should be made
only when explicitly asked for.

By default, the Make rules should compile and link with <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP>, so
that executable programs have debugging symbols.  Users who don't mind
being helpless can strip the executables later if they wish.

<DT><SAMP>`install'</SAMP>
<DD>
Compile the program and copy the executables, libraries, and so on to
the file names where they should reside for actual use.  If there is a
simple test to verify that a program is properly installed, this target
should run that test.

Do not strip executables when installing them.  Devil-may-care users can
use the <CODE>install-strip</CODE> target to do that.

If possible, write the <CODE>install</CODE> target rule so that it does not
modify anything in the directory where the program was built, provided
<SAMP>`make all'</SAMP> has just been done.  This is convenient for building the
program under one user name and installing it under another.

The commands should create all the directories in which files are to be
installed, if they don't already exist.  This includes the directories
specified as the values of the variables <CODE>prefix</CODE> and
<CODE>exec_prefix</CODE>, as well as all subdirectories that are needed.
One way to do this is by means of an <CODE>installdirs</CODE> target
as described below.

Use <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> before any command for installing a man page, so that
<CODE>make</CODE> will ignore any errors.  This is in case there are systems
that don't have the Unix man page documentation system installed.

The way to install Info files is to copy them into <TT>`$(infodir)'</TT>
with <CODE>$(INSTALL_DATA)</CODE> (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC119">Variables for Specifying Commands</A>), and then run
the <CODE>install-info</CODE> program if it is present.  <CODE>install-info</CODE>
is a program that edits the Info <TT>`dir'</TT> file to add or update the
menu entry for the given Info file; it is part of the Texinfo package.
Here is a sample rule to install an Info file:


<PRE>
$(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/foo.info: foo.info
        $(POST_INSTALL)
# There may be a newer info file in . than in srcdir.
        -if test -f foo.info; then d=.; \
         else d=$(srcdir); fi; \
        $(INSTALL_DATA) $$d/foo.info $(DESTDIR)$@; \
# Run install-info only if it exists.
# Use `if' instead of just prepending `-' to the
# line so we notice real errors from install-info.
# We use `$(SHELL) -c' because some shells do not
# fail gracefully when there is an unknown command.
        if $(SHELL) -c 'install-info --version' \
           &#62;/dev/null 2&#62;&#38;1; then \
          install-info --dir-file=$(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/dir \
                       $(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/foo.info; \
        else true; fi
</PRE>

When writing the <CODE>install</CODE> target, you must classify all the
commands into three categories: normal ones, <STRONG>pre-installation</STRONG>
commands and <STRONG>post-installation</STRONG> commands.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC122">Install Command Categories</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`uninstall'</SAMP>
<DD>
Delete all the installed files--the copies that the <SAMP>`install'</SAMP>
target creates.

This rule should not modify the directories where compilation is done,
only the directories where files are installed.

The uninstallation commands are divided into three categories, just like
the installation commands.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC122">Install Command Categories</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`install-strip'</SAMP>
<DD>
Like <CODE>install</CODE>, but strip the executable files while installing
them.  In many cases, the definition of this target can be very simple:


<PRE>
install-strip:
        $(MAKE) INSTALL_PROGRAM='$(INSTALL_PROGRAM) -s' \
                install
</PRE>

Normally we do not recommend stripping an executable unless you are sure
the program has no bugs.  However, it can be reasonable to install a
stripped executable for actual execution while saving the unstripped
executable elsewhere in case there is a bug.

<DT><SAMP>`clean'</SAMP>
<DD>
Delete all files from the current directory that are normally created by
building the program.  Don't delete the files that record the
configuration.  Also preserve files that could be made by building, but
normally aren't because the distribution comes with them.

Delete <TT>`.dvi'</TT> files here if they are not part of the distribution.

<DT><SAMP>`distclean'</SAMP>
<DD>
Delete all files from the current directory that are created by
configuring or building the program.  If you have unpacked the source
and built the program without creating any other files, <SAMP>`make
distclean'</SAMP> should leave only the files that were in the distribution.

<DT><SAMP>`mostlyclean'</SAMP>
<DD>
Like <SAMP>`clean'</SAMP>, but may refrain from deleting a few files that people
normally don't want to recompile.  For example, the <SAMP>`mostlyclean'</SAMP>
target for GCC does not delete <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT>, because recompiling it
is rarely necessary and takes a lot of time.

<DT><SAMP>`maintainer-clean'</SAMP>
<DD>
Delete almost everything from the current directory that can be
reconstructed with this Makefile.  This typically includes everything
deleted by <CODE>distclean</CODE>, plus more: C source files produced by
Bison, tags tables, Info files, and so on.

The reason we say "almost everything" is that running the command
<SAMP>`make maintainer-clean'</SAMP> should not delete <TT>`configure'</TT> even if
<TT>`configure'</TT> can be remade using a rule in the Makefile.  More generally,
<SAMP>`make maintainer-clean'</SAMP> should not delete anything that needs to
exist in order to run <TT>`configure'</TT> and then begin to build the
program.  This is the only exception; <CODE>maintainer-clean</CODE> should
delete everything else that can be rebuilt.

The <SAMP>`maintainer-clean'</SAMP> target is intended to be used by a maintainer of
the package, not by ordinary users.  You may need special tools to
reconstruct some of the files that <SAMP>`make maintainer-clean'</SAMP> deletes.
Since these files are normally included in the distribution, we don't
take care to make them easy to reconstruct.  If you find you need to
unpack the full distribution again, don't blame us.

To help make users aware of this, the commands for the special
<CODE>maintainer-clean</CODE> target should start with these two:


<PRE>
@echo 'This command is intended for maintainers to use; it'
@echo 'deletes files that may need special tools to rebuild.'
</PRE>

<DT><SAMP>`TAGS'</SAMP>
<DD>
Update a tags table for this program.

<DT><SAMP>`info'</SAMP>
<DD>
Generate any Info files needed.  The best way to write the rules is as
follows:


<PRE>
info: foo.info

foo.info: foo.texi chap1.texi chap2.texi
        $(MAKEINFO) $(srcdir)/foo.texi
</PRE>

You must define the variable <CODE>MAKEINFO</CODE> in the Makefile.  It should
run the <CODE>makeinfo</CODE> program, which is part of the Texinfo
distribution.

Normally a GNU distribution comes with Info files, and that means the
Info files are present in the source directory.  Therefore, the Make
rule for an info file should update it in the source directory.  When
users build the package, ordinarily Make will not update the Info files
because they will already be up to date.

<DT><SAMP>`dvi'</SAMP>
<DD>
Generate DVI files for all Texinfo documentation.
For example:


<PRE>
dvi: foo.dvi

foo.dvi: foo.texi chap1.texi chap2.texi
        $(TEXI2DVI) $(srcdir)/foo.texi
</PRE>

You must define the variable <CODE>TEXI2DVI</CODE> in the Makefile.  It should
run the program <CODE>texi2dvi</CODE>, which is part of the Texinfo
distribution.<A NAME="DOCF3" HREF="make.html#FOOT3">(3)</A>  Alternatively,
write just the dependencies, and allow GNU <CODE>make</CODE> to provide the command.

<DT><SAMP>`dist'</SAMP>
<DD>
Create a distribution tar file for this program.  The tar file should be
set up so that the file names in the tar file start with a subdirectory
name which is the name of the package it is a distribution for.  This
name can include the version number.

For example, the distribution tar file of GCC version 1.40 unpacks into
a subdirectory named <TT>`gcc-1.40'</TT>.

The easiest way to do this is to create a subdirectory appropriately
named, use <CODE>ln</CODE> or <CODE>cp</CODE> to install the proper files in it, and
then <CODE>tar</CODE> that subdirectory.

Compress the tar file file with <CODE>gzip</CODE>.  For example, the actual
distribution file for GCC version 1.40 is called <TT>`gcc-1.40.tar.gz'</TT>.

The <CODE>dist</CODE> target should explicitly depend on all non-source files
that are in the distribution, to make sure they are up to date in the
distribution.
See section `Making Releases' in <CITE>GNU Coding Standards</CITE>.

<DT><SAMP>`check'</SAMP>
<DD>
Perform self-tests (if any).  The user must build the program before
running the tests, but need not install the program; you should write
the self-tests so that they work when the program is built but not
installed.
</DL>

<P>
The following targets are suggested as conventional names, for programs
in which they are useful.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>installcheck</CODE>
<DD>
Perform installation tests (if any).  The user must build and install
the program before running the tests.  You should not assume that
<TT>`$(bindir)'</TT> is in the search path.

<DT><CODE>installdirs</CODE>
<DD>
It's useful to add a target named <SAMP>`installdirs'</SAMP> to create the
directories where files are installed, and their parent directories.
There is a script called <TT>`mkinstalldirs'</TT> which is convenient for
this; you can find it in the Texinfo package.
You can use a rule like this:


<PRE>
# Make sure all installation directories (e.g. $(bindir))
# actually exist by making them if necessary.
installdirs: mkinstalldirs
        $(srcdir)/mkinstalldirs $(bindir) $(datadir) \
                                $(libdir) $(infodir) \
                                $(mandir)
</PRE>

This rule should not modify the directories where compilation is done.
It should do nothing but create installation directories.
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC122" HREF="make.html#TOC122">Install Command Categories</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX921"></A>
<A NAME="IDX922"></A>
When writing the <CODE>install</CODE> target, you must classify all the
commands into three categories: normal ones, <STRONG>pre-installation</STRONG>
commands and <STRONG>post-installation</STRONG> commands.

</P>
<P>
Normal commands move files into their proper places, and set their
modes.  They may not alter any files except the ones that come entirely
from the package they belong to.

</P>
<P>
Pre-installation and post-installation commands may alter other files;
in particular, they can edit global configuration files or data bases.

</P>
<P>
Pre-installation commands are typically executed before the normal
commands, and post-installation commands are typically run after the
normal commands.

</P>
<P>
The most common use for a post-installation command is to run
<CODE>install-info</CODE>.  This cannot be done with a normal command, since
it alters a file (the Info directory) which does not come entirely and
solely from the package being installed.  It is a post-installation
command because it needs to be done after the normal command which
installs the package's Info files.

</P>
<P>
Most programs don't need any pre-installation commands, but we have the
feature just in case it is needed.

</P>
<P>
To classify the commands in the <CODE>install</CODE> rule into these three
categories, insert <STRONG>category lines</STRONG> among them.  A category line
specifies the category for the commands that follow.

</P>
<P>
A category line consists of a tab and a reference to a special Make
variable, plus an optional comment at the end.  There are three
variables you can use, one for each category; the variable name
specifies the category.  Category lines are no-ops in ordinary execution
because these three Make variables are normally undefined (and you
<EM>should not</EM> define them in the makefile).

</P>
<P>
Here are the three possible category lines, each with a comment that
explains what it means:

</P>

<PRE>
        $(PRE_INSTALL)     # Pre-install commands follow.
        $(POST_INSTALL)    # Post-install commands follow.
        $(NORMAL_INSTALL)  # Normal commands follow.
</PRE>

<P>
If you don't use a category line at the beginning of the <CODE>install</CODE>
rule, all the commands are classified as normal until the first category
line.  If you don't use any category lines, all the commands are
classified as normal.

</P>
<P>
These are the category lines for <CODE>uninstall</CODE>:

</P>

<PRE>
        $(PRE_UNINSTALL)     # Pre-uninstall commands follow.
        $(POST_UNINSTALL)    # Post-uninstall commands follow.
        $(NORMAL_UNINSTALL)  # Normal commands follow.
</PRE>

<P>
Typically, a pre-uninstall command would be used for deleting entries
from the Info directory.

</P>
<P>
If the <CODE>install</CODE> or <CODE>uninstall</CODE> target has any dependencies
which act as subroutines of installation, then you should start
<EM>each</EM> dependency's commands with a category line, and start the
main target's commands with a category line also.  This way, you can
ensure that each command is placed in the right category regardless of
which of the dependencies actually run.

</P>
<P>
Pre-installation and post-installation commands should not run any
programs except for these:

</P>

<PRE>
[ basename bash cat chgrp chmod chown cmp cp dd diff echo
egrep expand expr false fgrep find getopt grep gunzip gzip
hostname install install-info kill ldconfig ln ls md5sum
mkdir mkfifo mknod mv printenv pwd rm rmdir sed sort tee
test touch true uname xargs yes
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX923"></A>
The reason for distinguishing the commands in this way is for the sake
of making binary packages.  Typically a binary package contains all the
executables and other files that need to be installed, and has its own
method of installing them--so it does not need to run the normal
installation commands.  But installing the binary package does need to
execute the pre-installation and post-installation commands.

</P>
<P>
Programs to build binary packages work by extracting the
pre-installation and post-installation commands.  Here is one way of
extracting the pre-installation commands:

</P>

<PRE>
make -n install -o all \
      PRE_INSTALL=pre-install \
      POST_INSTALL=post-install \
      NORMAL_INSTALL=normal-install \
  | gawk -f pre-install.awk
</PRE>

<P>
where the file <TT>`pre-install.awk'</TT> could contain this:

</P>

<PRE>
$0 ~ /^\t[ \t]*(normal_install|post_install)[ \t]*$/ {on = 0}
on {print $0}
$0 ~ /^\t[ \t]*pre_install[ \t]*$/ {on = 1}
</PRE>

<P>
The resulting file of pre-installation commands is executed as a shell
script as part of installing the binary package.

</P>

<P>
These variables are used specially by GNU <CODE>make</CODE>:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE>
<DD>
Makefiles to be read on every invocation of <CODE>make</CODE>.<BR>
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC16">The Variable <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE></A>.

<DT><CODE>VPATH</CODE>
<DD>
Directory search path for files not found in the current directory.<BR>
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC27"><CODE>VPATH</CODE>: Search Path for All Prerequisites</A>.

<DT><CODE>SHELL</CODE>
<DD>
The name of the system default command interpreter, usually <TT>`/bin/sh'</TT>.
You can set <CODE>SHELL</CODE> in the makefile to change the shell used to run
commands.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC46">Command Execution</A>.

<DT><CODE>MAKESHELL</CODE>
<DD>
On MS-DOS only, the name of the command interpreter that is to be used
by <CODE>make</CODE>. This value takes precedence over the value of
<CODE>SHELL</CODE>.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC46">Command Execution</A>.

<DT><CODE>MAKE</CODE>
<DD>
The name with which <CODE>make</CODE> was invoked.
Using this variable in commands has special meaning.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC51">How the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> Variable Works</A>.

<DT><CODE>MAKELEVEL</CODE>
<DD>
The number of levels of recursion (sub-<CODE>make</CODE>s).<BR>
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC52">Communicating Variables to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>.

<DT><CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE>
<DD>
The flags given to <CODE>make</CODE>.  You can set this in the environment or
a makefile to set flags.<BR>
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC53">Communicating Options to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>.

It is <EM>never</EM> appropriate to use <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> directly on a
command line: its contents may not be quoted correctly for use in the
shell.  Always allow recursive <CODE>make</CODE>'s to obtain these values
through the environment from its parent.

<DT><CODE>MAKECMDGOALS</CODE>
<DD>
The targets given to <CODE>make</CODE> on the command line.  Setting this
variable has no effect on the operation of <CODE>make</CODE>.<BR>
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC87">Arguments to Specify the Goals</A>.

<DT><CODE>CURDIR</CODE>
<DD>
Set to the pathname of the current working directory (after all
<CODE>-C</CODE> options are processed, if any).  Setting this variable has no
effect on the operation of <CODE>make</CODE>.<BR>
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC50">Recursive Use of <CODE>make</CODE></A>.

<DT><CODE>SUFFIXES</CODE>

<H1><A NAME="SEC124" HREF="make.html#TOC124">Errors Generated by Make</A></H1>

<P>
Here is a list of the more common errors you might see generated by
<CODE>make</CODE>, and some information about what they mean and how to fix
them.

</P>
<P>
Sometimes <CODE>make</CODE> errors are not fatal, especially in the presence
of a <CODE>-</CODE> prefix on a command script line, or the <CODE>-k</CODE> command
line option.  Errors that are fatal are prefixed with the string
<CODE>***</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Error messages are all either prefixed with the name of the program
(usually <SAMP>`make'</SAMP>), or, if the error is found in a makefile, the name
of the file and linenumber containing the problem.

</P>
<P>
In the table below, these common prefixes are left off.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`[<VAR>foo</VAR>] Error <VAR>NN</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`[<VAR>foo</VAR>] <VAR>signal description</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
These errors are not really <CODE>make</CODE> errors at all.  They mean that a
program that <CODE>make</CODE> invoked as part of a command script returned a
non-0 error code (<SAMP>`Error <VAR>NN</VAR>'</SAMP>), which <CODE>make</CODE> interprets
as failure, or it exited in some other abnormal fashion (with a
signal of some type).  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC48">Errors in Commands</A>.

If no <CODE>***</CODE> is attached to the message, then the subprocess failed
but the rule in the makefile was prefixed with the <CODE>-</CODE> special
character, so <CODE>make</CODE> ignored the error.

<DT><SAMP>`missing separator.  Stop.'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`missing separator (did you mean TAB instead of 8 spaces?).  Stop.'</SAMP>
<DD>
This means that <CODE>make</CODE> could not understand much of anything about
the command line it just read.  GNU <CODE>make</CODE> looks for various kinds
of separators (<CODE>:</CODE>, <CODE>=</CODE>, TAB characters, etc.) to help it
decide what kind of commandline it's seeing.  This means it couldn't
find a valid one.

One of the most common reasons for this message is that you (or perhaps
your oh-so-helpful editor, as is the case with many MS-Windows editors)
have attempted to indent your command scripts with spaces instead of a
TAB character.  In this case, <CODE>make</CODE> will use the second form of
the error above.  Remember that every line in the command script must
begin with a TAB character.  Eight spaces do not count.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC21">Rule Syntax</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`commands commence before first target.  Stop.'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`missing rule before commands.  Stop.'</SAMP>
<DD>
This means the first thing in the makefile seems to be part of a command
script: it begins with a TAB character and doesn't appear to be a legal
<CODE>make</CODE> command (such as a variable assignment).  Command scripts
must always be associated with a target.

The second form is generated if the line has a semicolon as the first
non-whitespace character; <CODE>make</CODE> interprets this to mean you left
out the "target: prerequisite" section of a rule.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC21">Rule Syntax</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`No rule to make target `<VAR>xxx</VAR>'.'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`No rule to make target `<VAR>xxx</VAR>', needed by `<VAR>yyy</VAR>'.'</SAMP>
<DD>
This means that <CODE>make</CODE> decided it needed to build a target, but
then couldn't find any instructions in the makefile on how to do that,
either explicit or implicit (including in the default rules database).

If you want that file to be built, you will need to add a rule to your
makefile describing how that target can be built.  Other possible
sources of this problem are typos in the makefile (if that filename is
wrong) or a corrupted source tree (if that file is not supposed to be
built, but rather only a prerequisite).

<DT><SAMP>`No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`No targets.  Stop.'</SAMP>
<DD>
The former means that you didn't provide any targets to be built on the
command line, and <CODE>make</CODE> couldn't find any makefiles to read in.
The latter means that some makefile was found, but it didn't contain any
default target and none was given on the command line.  GNU <CODE>make</CODE>
has nothing to do in these situations.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC86">Arguments to Specify the Makefile</A>.
<DT><SAMP>`Makefile `<VAR>xxx</VAR>' was not found.'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`Included makefile `<VAR>xxx</VAR>' was not found.'</SAMP>
<DD>
A makefile specified on the command line (first form) or included
(second form) was not found.

<DT><SAMP>`warning: overriding commands for target `<VAR>xxx</VAR>''</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`warning: ignoring old commands for target `<VAR>xxx</VAR>''</SAMP>
<DD>
GNU <CODE>make</CODE> allows commands to be specified only once per target
(except for double-colon rules).  If you give commands for a target
which already has been defined to have commands, this warning is issued
and the second set of commands will overwrite the first set.
See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC38">Multiple Rules for One Target</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`Circular <VAR>xxx</VAR> &#60;- <VAR>yyy</VAR> dependency dropped.'</SAMP>
<DD>
This means that <CODE>make</CODE> detected a loop in the dependency graph:
after tracing the prerequisite <VAR>yyy</VAR> of target <VAR>xxx</VAR>, and its
prerequisites, etc., one of them depended on <VAR>xxx</VAR> again.

<DT><SAMP>`Recursive variable `<VAR>xxx</VAR>' references itself (eventually).  Stop.'</SAMP>
<DD>
This means you've defined a normal (recursive) <CODE>make</CODE> variable
<VAR>xxx</VAR> that, when it's expanded, will refer to itself (<VAR>xxx</VAR>).
This is not allowed; either use simply-expanded variables (<CODE>:=</CODE>) or
use the append operator (<CODE>+=</CODE>).  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC57">How to Use Variables</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`Unterminated variable reference.  Stop.'</SAMP>
<DD>
This means you forgot to provide the proper closing parenthesis
or brace in your variable or function reference.

<DT><SAMP>`insufficient arguments to function `<VAR>xxx</VAR>'.  Stop.'</SAMP>
<DD>
This means you haven't provided the requisite number of arguments for
this function.  See the documentation of the function for a description
of its arguments.  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC75">Functions for Transforming Text</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`missing target pattern.  Stop.'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`multiple target patterns.  Stop.'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`target pattern contains no `%'.  Stop.'</SAMP>
<DD>
These are generated for malformed static pattern rules.  The first means
there's no pattern in the target section of the rule, the second means
there are multiple patterns in the target section, and the third means
the target doesn't contain a pattern character (<CODE>%</CODE>).  See section <A HREF="make.html#SEC40">Syntax of Static Pattern Rules</A>.

<DT><SAMP>`warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.'</SAMP>
<DD>
This warning and the next are generated if <CODE>make</CODE> detects error
conditions related to parallel processing on systems where
sub-<CODE>make</CODE>s can communicate (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC53">Communicating Options to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>).  This warning is
generated if a recursive invocation of a <CODE>make</CODE> process is forced
to have <SAMP>`-j<VAR>N</VAR>'</SAMP> in its argument list (where <VAR>N</VAR> is greater
than one).  This could happen, for example, if you set the <CODE>MAKE</CODE>
environment variable to <SAMP>`make -j2'</SAMP>.  In this case, the
sub-<CODE>make</CODE> doesn't communicate with other <CODE>make</CODE> processes and
will simply pretend it has two jobs of its own.

<DT><SAMP>`warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.  Add `+' to parent make rule.'</SAMP>
<DD>
In order for <CODE>make</CODE> processes to communicate, the parent will pass
information to the child.  Since this could result in problems if the
child process isn't actually a <CODE>make</CODE>, the parent will only do this
if it thinks the child is a <CODE>make</CODE>.  The parent uses the normal
algorithms to determine this (see section <A HREF="make.html#SEC51">How the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> Variable Works</A>).  If the makefile is constructed such that the parent
doesn't know the child is a <CODE>make</CODE> process, then the child will
receive only part of the information necessary.  In this case, the child
will generate this warning message and proceed with its build in a
sequential manner.

<H1><A NAME="SEC125" HREF="make.html#TOC125">Complex Makefile Example</A></H1>

<P>
Here is the makefile for the GNU <CODE>tar</CODE> program.  This is a
moderately complex makefile.

</P>
<P>
Because it is the first target, the default goal is <SAMP>`all'</SAMP>.  An
interesting feature of this makefile is that <TT>`testpad.h'</TT> is a
source file automatically created by the <CODE>testpad</CODE> program,
itself compiled from <TT>`testpad.c'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If you type <SAMP>`make'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`make all'</SAMP>, then <CODE>make</CODE> creates
the <TT>`tar'</TT> executable, the <TT>`rmt'</TT> daemon that provides
remote tape access, and the <TT>`tar.info'</TT> Info file.

</P>
<P>
If you type <SAMP>`make install'</SAMP>, then <CODE>make</CODE> not only creates
<TT>`tar'</TT>, <TT>`rmt'</TT>, and <TT>`tar.info'</TT>, but also installs
them.

</P>
<P>
If you type <SAMP>`make clean'</SAMP>, then <CODE>make</CODE> removes the <SAMP>`.o'</SAMP>
files, and the <TT>`tar'</TT>, <TT>`rmt'</TT>, <TT>`testpad'</TT>,
<TT>`testpad.h'</TT>, and <TT>`core'</TT> files.

</P>
<P>
If you type <SAMP>`make distclean'</SAMP>, then <CODE>make</CODE> not only removes
the same files as does <SAMP>`make clean'</SAMP> but also the
<TT>`TAGS'</TT>, <TT>`Makefile'</TT>, and <TT>`config.status'</TT> files.
(Although it is not evident, this makefile (and
<TT>`config.status'</TT>) is generated by the user with the
<CODE>configure</CODE> program, which is provided in the <CODE>tar</CODE>
distribution, but is not shown here.)

</P>
<P>
If you type <SAMP>`make realclean'</SAMP>, then <CODE>make</CODE> removes the same
files as does <SAMP>`make distclean'</SAMP> and also removes the Info files
generated from <TT>`tar.texinfo'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
In addition, there are targets <CODE>shar</CODE> and <CODE>dist</CODE> that create
distribution kits.
