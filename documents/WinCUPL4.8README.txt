DEVICE SUPPORT
--------------

ATF16V8C/ATF22V10C - This version support these new Atmel product. Selecting
these device type (E.g. g22v10cp) automatically enables the pin controlled
power down feature on these device. WinCUPL will check if your logic is using
the power down pin and report an error.

ATF1508 - The ATF1508-68PLCC, ATF1508-84PLCC and ATF1508-100QFP devices are
now support on this release. Manually pin assignment like the ATF1500/A are
not necessary. A device fitter for the ATF1508 is included in this release. 

BUG FIXES:
----------
Refer to the CUPL_BUG.TXT file included with this version of CUPL for a list of
bug fixes. You can obtain the latest version of this file from the Atmel BBS 
and check it to see if there is a workaround for your particular bug. If you 
find a bug that is not included in this list, please contact Atmel PLD 
Applications. 

CUPL MODULE CHANGES:
--------------------
Device Library: Added ATF16V8C/CZ, ATF22V10C/CZ and ATF1500A device support

CUPLB:          Fixed f1500 device types that had two term equations being 
                demorganized but were not expanded correctly in the pla file.
		    Module now checks is ISP device is select for a design that
		    uses the JTAG port pins. Syntax error point to signal name.

CUPLC:          Fixed some memory corruption bugs. Changed the v2500b jedec 
                mapping to configure the IO cells better. 

VSIMA:          Fixed some simulation support bugs for the ATF1500 device.

BACKPIN:        Upgraded version allows for back-annotation of Atmel ATF1500 
                fitter pin assignments. 

ONLINE HELP:
------------
On-line help is available. Use to on-line help to obtain information about CUPL
syntax, suffix usage, Keywords, How to use Atmel-Wincupl and error messages.

   Select the help topic to display from the listing

FLIP-FLOP SYNTHESIS:
--------------------
You can use D,T,JK or RS type flip-flops to capture your design.
WINCUPL can automatically convert equations for these flip-flop into
equivalent expression for D or T type flip-flops supported by Atmel devices
through the REGISTER_SELECT Keyword. This keyword can also be used to allow
WINCUPL to automatically choose the appropriate flip-flop type that results
in the fewest number of product terms for your design.
More information on this Keyword is available in the WINCUPL On-line HELP.

Refer to CONVERT.PLD CUPL example.  Note that all CUPL example files
are located in the EXAMPLES directory.


=========================
4. IMPORTANT INFORMATION
=========================

GENERAL:
-------
You may notice that some large text files (> 24Kbytes) such as PLD source,
simulation input, output and/or fitter report files may fail to open in WINCUPL.
You may see an "Out of Memory","Fail to read" of General Protection Fault errors
when attempting to view a particular file.  If you experience the 
"Out of Memory" or "Fail to read" error you can still view the file provided 
that it exists.  To view the file:

1. Select DOS PROMPT under the UTILITIES menu in WINCUPL. This will open
   the DOS prompt in WINCUPL.

2. Type: edit <filename> where <filename> represents the DOS path to the file.
   This will invoke the DOS editor to allow the file to be viewed.

3. Type: EXIT from the FILE Menu in the DOS editor.
   This will exit the DOS editor and return to the DOS prompt 

4. Type: EXIT in the DOS prompt. This will close the DOS prompt and return to 
   the WINCUPL main menu.   

If you see a General Protection Fault (GPF) error, exit WinCUPL and re-run this
should correct the problem. This error can also be minimized by having fewer 
file open during compilation.

DEVICE SPECIFICS:
-----------------
A. Support has been added for the Atmel ATF16V8C/CZ device.
   - If you want to enable the pin-controlled power down feature on the Atmel
     ATF16V8C select the "g16v8cp" device type.  Refer to GATES_C.PLD file.
     Note: If you select this device type, you will need to select the ATF16V8C
           device with a "EXT" suffix on your programmer device menu listing.
   - If you want to disable pin-controlled power down feature select "g16v8a"
     device type.

B. If you are generating a simulation file for the g16v8cp device type you must 
   specify pin 4 to be zero. If you do not, WINCUPL will automatically 
   overwrite it to a zero. This is required for functional verification of the
   ATF16V8C/CZ on the programmer when the pin-controlled power down mode is 
   enabled.

C. Support has been added for the Atmel ATF22V10C/CZ device. 
   - If you want to enable the pin-controlled power down feature select either
     the "g22v10cp" or "g22v10cplcc" device types for DIP or PLCC packages 
     respectively.  Refer to LOOKUP.PLD file.
     Note: If you select this device type, you will need to select the ATF22V10C
           device with a "EXT" suffix" on your programmer device menu listing.
   - If you want to disable the pin-controlled power down feature select 
     either the "g22v10" or "g22v10lcc" device types.  
     Note: If you select this device type, you may need to select the ATF22V10C
           device with a "U" or "UES" suffix on your programmer device menu 
           listing.

D. If you are generating a simulation file for the g22v10cp or g22v10cplcc 
   device types you must specify pin 4 for DIP or pin 5 for PLCC to be zero. 
   If you do not, WINCUPL will automatically overwrite it to a zero. This is 
   required for functional verification of the ATF22V10C/CZ on the programmer 
   when the pin-controlled power down mode is enabled.  Refer to CUPL_BUG.TXT
   for bug information.

E. Support has been added for the ATF1500A device. This device allows the 
   Bus-friendly Pin Keeper circuits to be enabled or disabled.  The pin keeper
   circuit will weakly hold all outputs to their previoulsy defined states when
   the outputs are disabled. The pin-keeper circuits are easily overdriven when
   the ouputs are enabled. When this feature is disabled all output will float
   when tri-stated. 

   Note: Pin Keeper circuits are also available on the ATF1500 devices, but they
         cannot be disabled.

   Refer to the "Atmel PLD Design Guidelines" applications note on information 
   on the pin-keeper circuits.

   You can enable of disable the pin-keeper circuits by using the CUPL property
   statement.

   1. To Disable this Feature:
      In your PLD source file add the line:

         PROPERTY ATMEL { pin_keep OFF };

      and re-compile your design for either the F1500A or F1500AT
      device types. The fitter will automatically create a JEDEC file
      which when programming into the ATF1500A device will disable the
      pin-keeper circuits. 

   2.  To Enable this feature:

         PROPERTY ATMEL { pin_keep ON };  /* This is the default condition,
                                             so this statement can be omitted */

   Refer to PINKEEP.PLD CUPL example.

F. Security Bit
   You can secure your ATF1500A designs by programming the security bit. To 
   secure a design

   1. Select either the F1500A or F1500AT device type

   2. In you PLD source file add the line:

        PROPERTY ATMEL { security ON };

      and re-compile your design. The fitter will automatically create a
      JEDEC file which, when programmed into the ATF1500A device, will secure 
      the device.

   Note that some programmers require you to manually enable the security bit
   via their menu options (regardless of whether the security bit is enabled in
   the JEDEC file).

   Refer to PINKEEP.PLD CUPL example.

G. For ATF1500/A designs, the Atmel ATF1500 fitter can generate pin assignments for
   you and WINCUPL can automatically back-annotate them into your PLD source 
   file. It you are interested in using this feature do the following:

   1. Generate your PLD source file for the ATF1500/A without pin assignments.
   
   2. Compile the design in WINCUPL. The fitter will run automatically.

   3. Run the BACKPIN utility. 
      In the DOS prompt,
      Type: backpin <device mnemonic> <PLD source file> 

      The <device mnemonic> is the appropriate CUPL ATF1500 device type
      For example: f1500, f1500t, f1500a, f1500at

      The <PLD source file> is the (*.pld) PLD source file which describes your
      design.

      The BACKPIN utility reads a pin assignment file (*.plc file) automatically 
      generated by the Atmel ATF1500 fitter and produces a new PLD source file 
      (*.pld file). The new source file will have the fitter pin assignments back-
      annotated within it. Backpin will automatically make a backup copy of the 
      original source file. This file is named using the (*.bak) suffix. 

   4. In the new source file include this line:

      PROPERTY ATMEL {PREASSIGN KEEP}; 

      The KEEP fitter pre-assignment property allows you to fix your pin 
      assignments in your PLD source file, whether generated automatically by 
      BACKPIN or manually.

   5. Re-save the PLD source file. 

   6. Re-compile the PLD source File in WINCUPL. 

H. For ATF1508 design WinCUPL support two device types. One device type disables
   the JTAG port, and allow design that use the JTAG port pin to be programmed once.
   The other device type enables the JTAG port and allow design that DO NOT use
   the JTAG port pin to be programmed. If you plan to program the ATF1508 using
   In-System Programming (ISP) you must choose the ISP device type. If you select
   an ISP device type for a design that uses the JTAG port pin WinCUPL will generate
   an error. See table below for ATF1508 WinCUPL Device types

            Table 1- WINCUPL ATF1508 Device Types
   -------------------------------------------------------
   |Device            |  JTAG Port | WINCUPL Device Type |
    -----------------------------------------------------
   |ATF1508 -68PLCC   |  Enabled   | f1508ispplcc68      |
